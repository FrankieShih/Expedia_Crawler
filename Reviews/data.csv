Great hotel!
I had a great stay at the arlo nomad. The room was clean and comfortable and very thoughtfully laid out with an area to work and sit. The toiletries were good quality and the water pressure in the shower was great. My room was cleaned each day and the staff was very friendly. They have a hair dryer and a steamer in the room which is great! The restaurant in the hotel was also delicious and the bar/lounge was very cute and cozy. Will definitely stay again!

Solid, clean, stylish
Really nice, clean hotel. Room was spacious by NYC standards (which is to say, it was tiny, but you could move without falling down). Elevator wait time was annoying, but it wasn't too dissimilar to other NYC elevator experiences I have had. I found the lack of a coffeemaker in the room annoying, given the low cost to the hotel of providing it. I really appreciated all of the coworking space on the second floor (great for business meetings).

The pros: The view from our King Sky Room was as spectacular as we expected. It was so cool falling asleep and waking up to the incredible skyline. The staff was also very friendly and helpful, we loved the free breakfast and cocktail hour, and the rooftop was gorgeous. Aside from the view, we didn't like the room itself. It was most definitely a micro-room, with no closet, dresser, nightstands or even a full bathroom door. There was nowhere to put our stuff or our single suitcase. We only stayed for one night, but I couldn't imagine staying here for longer or with more luggage. I'd definitely be very annoyed. The bed was surrounded by windows/the wall on three sides so my husband, who slept next to the window, literally had to climb over me to get out of bed. Also the room wasn't totally clean, which was made more obvious in the brightness of the room. Plus the room was right next to a utility room and we heard hotel staff talking and clanging around at all hours. It was super loud.

Overall, this was a great hotel. The room was very clean and modern looking. While it was small, there were plenty of places to stash belongings. The bathroom lacked privacy (just a sliding door that had gaps around the edges), but this was not a huge problem for us. Overall a great find!

Centrally located, the hotel is adequate.... but honestly, it's all the ""added costs"" that were a turn-off. What is billed as a $175 hotel turned out to be more like almost $275 a night. I felt ""fleeced"". Rooms are small but clean and quiet. Elevator is glacially slow. Staff was accomodating.

My Go-To Hotel
I__ an ex New Yorker who comes back to the city for family & business. Have been trying a variety of hotels and must say Arlo Nomad wins the prize. This will be the hotel I stay at when I come into the city. The moment I walked in, was treated with a warm smile and - of course, we__l put your case in your room waiting for you, when you return later. I had an extremely small room ( which is all I needed) that felt warm and cozy. Loved the bed and pillows and the view! The location is perfect.

Amazing view
The hotel location was perfect and the views out of our queen sky room were second to none. The room was very small but you could fit your suitcases under the bed so it was very workable. My number one complaint is there__ no coffee pot in the room. There is a little coffee shop in the lobby that you could go down to, however having a cup of coffee before facing the world is a thing that I rather enjoy.

Perfect Location and Staff. Can't say more.
Overall, I have mixed feelings about this hotel. It fully deserves a 5/5 for staff and location. The staff was more than welcoming and willing to listen and help with any issues. And you are within walking distance of major NY landmarks and subway stations. Plus, the elevators are fast and the hotel offers free wine at some point in the afternoon. On the other hand, there were some things that I had hoped would be better given the $250/night price tag. I was travelling with my mom so I got us a bunkbed room so that we wouldn't share beds. The room is small, but that's not the main issue. There's barely any storage area so we forced to store most of our things on the floor. Second, the bathroom offers little privacy other than a matte glass door that doesn't really go all the way up, being the only thing between someone in the room and someone in the restroom taking care of business. I have mentioned this to the hotel and they offered a shower curtain which we already had. Third, the internet is bad. I was using their Arlo Guest and it was slow and kept stopping from time to time and I would loose internet access, so much that it would get frustrating. I mentioned this to the reception and got access to their other password protected network. Unfortunately, that wasn't any better. Fourth, the A/C is loud even with the fan speed on low. The fact that it keeps stopping and starting when it hits the desired temperature doesn't help, it just makes it more annoying. Lastly, each b

Boutique hotel with modern amenities
Arlo Nomad is located near Koreatown and was convenient to all the places that I needed to travel to (Midtown East, Financial District). The hotel has great amenities (Wine Hours, partnership with a local Gym, Rooftop bar, etc) which you pay for via a convenience fee (so make sure you take advantage). The room are small but is modern & utilizes the small space smartly. For myself, I was able to get a room with a great of the Empire State building and surrounding buildings. Housekeeping was great and always kept the room tidy & clean. Front desk and other staff was friendly (they even let me check in early around 11 am) and responsive to my needs. If I need to stay in the area, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel.

The location of this hotel is fab! You are pretty much withing walking distance of all the tourist attractions. Not to mention you'll have an amazing view of Empire State Building (check out the roof top bar for the best pics!). If you ask for a Sky view room or City view room, you'll get those advertised rooms with the great views. The security in the hotel is great as you can't get anywhere without your hotel room key. The room was compact but pleasantly roomier than I think some people give it credit for. The shower and toilet are together behind a frosted glass wall so you will have to come out from the frosted sliding door to wash your hands after going to the bathroom. The room has USB plug sockets which is great for charging phones without the need of a US converter plug! They also provided a powerful hairdryer (yes, powerful enough for even frizzy hair!) and a steamer for those not wanting to wear suitcase creases.. Bed is really comfortable, as are the towels provided (another bonus and saving on luggage weight). There's a coffee shop just in the lobby to start the day the right way and free umbrellas to use for those blustery rainy New York days. On our last day, we checked out early and left our bags at the hotel to continue adventuring until we had to leave for JFK airport, which is about a 40 minute yellow cab away, and the hotel called the cab for us to make everything effortless. Would i stay again? In a heartbeat!

Great location and beautiful building. The room was small and it was not properly maintained; the bathroom curtain was broke and didn't fit properly, the carpet outside the bathroom was ripped and there two holes in the wall as you entered the room covered with stickers.

Great stay!
Convenient location in Midtown means it's easy to get anywhere in the city, having the subway nearby is also a plus. Friendly staff, awesome rooftop bar with great views. Room is on the small side but it's typical of New York City and good enough for a solo traveler.

Most reviews one reads for this hotel are excellent. However, the reality is not as described. Rooms are really small and not at all comfortable. Almost not fit for purpose. Noise from the elevators kept waking us each night too. My description would be its a very ordinary budget hotel, bordering on a hostel in style.

Great staff make up for tiny rooms (study the floor plan, then look at the photos). Main drawback is the inadequate provision of elevators, especially as guest elevators are used by housekeeping etc as service elevators. Good location. Overpriced breakfast. Buzzing bar.

My Second Stay at Arlo NoMad
I frequently travel to New York for work and struggle with finding a hotel that I like enough to stick with. This we my second stay at the Arlo NoMad and it was wonderful! Although the rooms are quite small, the floor to ceiling windows make up for it! Comfortable bed, great bath amenities, great location, automatic blackout curtains, in room steamer, and a super convenient cafe. My only complaint is how slow the elevator is. I look forward to my next stay!

We enjoyed our stay at the Arlo Nomad for our Honeymoon. We stayed in one of the sky rooms which were the rooms On the top floors that overlooked New York. The views we__e gorgeous, especially at night. However, we definitely had to pay for this. Another thing to note are that these rooms are very tiny. The pictures do not do it justice. Overall, I would say our stay was pleasant enough. However, we probably would not stay here again just because you definitely do not get the biggest bang for your buck. Like I mentioned before, we had to pay a lot extra to stay in the sky rooms and there is Also an additional daily __lub/resort_ fee on top of everything else. Neat to experience once, if only for the views, but probably not a Second time.

Hidden Transactions!
I would give the Arlo Nomad a raving review if I hadn__ felt that the customer service was sub par when slyly charging my credit card not once but twice totaling near $300 in additional fees. What I mean by slyly is upon check in, no additional fees were mentioned when discussing my room and check in process. When I walked away, then my card was charged. Same thing happened upon check out. Upon inquiring the front desk to explain these fees I felt they were not upfront nor descriptive enough on what I was paying for. I still can__ tell you what I was charged this extra money for. When booking on the site I was charged daily additional fees so upon checking in and out I shouldn__ have been charged again. If I had known, I would have stayed elsewhere. Completely unprofessional. I will not be recommending this hotel to my colleagues.

The location and service is great. The rooms are also good. They are small but I knew that would be the case and it was fine. My only complaint is about the elevator service. The wait time for an elevator most times is excessively long. There are three elevators however one appears to only be used by service and therefore two elevators is not sufficient for the amount of rooms. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay very much.

Great location, cool vibes
Very good location on 31st street. Short walk to Empire State Building, Madison Square Park, Times Square. The hotel has a very cool and hip vibe, with a popular restaurant, and a rooftop bar. The rooms are pretty quiet at night and you don't hear much street noise. My room (basic 1 Queen Bed) is a little small but ok for a single person. The doors could be better sound proofed as you can hear conversations from the corridor pretty clearly. Minor quibble - when I was checking in, the clerk seemed a little pre-occupied and did not smile or even look at me when until handing my room key to me.

Loved staying at Arlo Nomad! The whole staff was just excellent especially Paola at the reception desk. She gave us so much advice on places to check out in NYC (since we were newbies to the city) and she was so sweet. I had called ahead a couple days before to see if there was a possibility of an early check in (since our flight came in at 9 am) and they said they would try. We were so thrilled when we got there and they told us they were able to have our room ready earlier. It was my bday weekend and I loved the sweet note they gave me. The room itself was just amazingggg! Lovedddddddd the view! I already miss it. I loved little things like the shower head, the plug ins for charging phones on each side of the bed, oh and they provide you with a steamer which I was ecstatic about. The location is also great and was in the more hip young adult side of town which fit our ages. It was in the middle of everything and so close to the subway. Overall, I had such a great experience with Arlo! I can__ wait to visit their Miami location :)

The location was great. The room was small, but we understood that going into it, and was perfect for us. Easily able to store our two carry-on luggage bags under the bed. The cable TV didn't work very well, but chrome cast worked wonderfully. We had a room that did not have a view (faced inward) and were on the eighth floor. The room was located next to the linen shoot. The room doors did not self-close and could easily be heard when others would have to slam them shut. We did not have a problem waiting for an elevator. The bed was comfortable after a long day of walking, but as a light sleeper my partner woke up with every noise in the hallway/bang of vents. House cleaning was efficient and kind. In-house shampoo, conditioner and shower gel were fine, but were scented; if you prefer unscented bring your own. The reception team was very kind/courteous and offered to keep our bags after checking out if our flight was later that evening. My partner and I both agree that either a keurig with one pod per each guest in the room or a gift certificate for a free coffee from their in-house ""bodega"" should have been provided, as it's a pretty standard complimentary service at most hotels.

Overall I was quite happy with our stay- the one thing that I didn__ love was the elevator(s) I spent way to much time waiting for elevators on this trip. While there are 2 it seems to take a very long time get from your room to the main floor:( and back again. Great location, cool design in a small but functional room. The staff was excellent and made some great restaurant suggestions! All in all a great stay!

Trendy hotel in NoMad central to Korea Town and it__ popular restaurants. Also close to Penn station. The rooms are tiny, with the usual bathroom behind a sliding glass door since there is not enough room for more. The bedding was comfortable. They have the __esort_ fee that is becoming so common despite providing no additional amenities beyond those of an ordinary hotel. Overall this is an ok choice for mid-Manhattan if you can get a decent room rate.

We enjoyed our stay at the Arlo NoMad. The locations was good for us. They have a happy hour with free drinks for hotel guests which was a welcome perk. Our room was clean and just like the photos. It was very small but had what you need. I want to give a huge shout out to the staff, who were helpful and friendly to a person. The front desk, luggage guys, bar tenders, everyone was very nice! I went to the coffee bar every morning and it was always quick and delicious. Thanks Arlo!

The staff was absolutely amazing! My partner and I visited NYC for a play and shopping for our anniversary. The staff had a bottle of wine and snacks for us with a beautiful card in the room, which was not expected and very much appreciated. The room, while not very large, felt spacious and was absolutely beautiful. The floor to wall glass in the corner room allowed a breathtaking view of the city as well as the river. After a nice day in the city, it was truly a pleasure to go back to the room and enjoy the sites. Honestly, I have never stayed in a hotel like this. Breakfast was absolutely incredible, and far from the customary American Continental fare offered at almost all hotels. It was fresh and offered a variety of choices to satisfy anyone with discriminating tastes. The next time I visit the city, I will definitely book a room at Arlo NoMad.

Great hotel despite tiny rooms!!!
From the moment we walked into this hotel I could tell there was something different about it. The staff was sincerely welcoming and in cited is to the daily happy hour on the second floor. It is hip but comfy. There are lots of common spaces in the first and second floors, including two large libraries with huge tables for workspace. The coffee shop is great. Their baked goods looked amazing. Didn__ do breakfast cause was too pricey for how much we eat. Rooms are very small but well thought out and comfortable beds. Wash products like shampoo and soap were wonderful_ even for a sensitive person like myself. Totally enjoyed our short stay. Will stay again if I can get a good rate. Always looking for reasonable and good places to stay midtown. Also really good restaurants in the area.

We are disheartened to read that the long waits for the elevators, along with our micro-concept rooms took away from your overall experience. We do our best to remain as transparent as possible when it comes to the size of our rooms; providing floors plans, photos and the actual square footage. We would love to host you again, should you wish to give us another try. All the best, - Benjamin Sebring | Director of Front Office"

I had a great time staying at Arlo Nomad. I wish I had spent more time checking out the lounge area and the rooftop bar, but I took a peek and they were really nice. The hotel felt clean and safe. The hotel room was super cozy and comfortable and I had a shockingly good sleep both nights. I found the room surprisingly quiet for New York. Staff were really helpful too. The front desk staff went above and beyond trying to help me figure out my airport shuttle. I was sad to go.

The rooftop bar is great with awesome views of midtown. Same could be said for our room which was a queen room on the 12th floor. Small room, but it was all we needed and was clean. Only negative is the wait on the elevators can be lengthier at times. When we checked out, 3 different elevators came and all were full. Know it was checkout time, and we were patient all weekend with, but at that point we took the stairs from 12 with our luggage. BUT that being said, I would stay there again in a heartbeat

Great hotel. Small rooms but who spends much time in their room when in NYC? Bed was very comfy, shower was great and room was clean. A couple times the elevator took 5-10 minutes to get to us but most of the time it was quick (we were on the 24th floor). Staff overall was very friendly except for one guy in the lobby who gave us a hard time for carrying down a glass from the rooftop bar when it started to rain?? Location is great with a ton of great restaurants and bars walking distance. I would definitely recommend this hotel to couples and singles. The only reason I wouldn't recommend for a family is the size of the rooms.

Staff members were very friendly and helpful whenever I needed their assistance. The hotel is in a great location especially if you're visiting NYC for the first time. Most things are reachable within walking distance. Otherwise, there are plenty of subway stations nearby so you don't have to worry. I had a wonderful stay there; the room was clean and tidy every day and the view!! View from the room was just amazing. Arlo Nomad has a fantastic rooftop bar as well and I thoroughly enjoyed it. All in all, I would love to stay at Arlo Nomad again. That's how much I loved it there. :)

Good stay but cannot check in earlier
The overall stay was awesome. My sister and I only stayed for one night and had a pleasant time. It is conveniently located by Penn Station, 15 min walk from M train, and a few walks away from the public buses. The only thought was their check-in is at 3 pm and I could not check in any earlier and there were no rooms. I typically have no issues in checking in earlier at other hotels so that__ something to keep in mind. Meanwhile, they have three bathrooms which is located on their second floor and the lights are pretty dim.

This property is central but small. The rooms are cramped but effectively designed. Not great for a couple. OK for a business person alone and not spending any time in the room. With this said there is lots of common area space for workings and they even give free happy hour. The staff is not the best, coffee in the morning is expensive and very very slow. No room service.

Do not choose.
Do not choose this place unless you like to stay in a cubical. Air con is loud and bad. This is a so called boutique hotel but their room it__ incredibly SMALL. Facility is just ok like every other 4 stars. Stayed for three days and two rooms total five nights. Not just merely one night deal. Service is fine although it__ the least for this hotel to offer.

Do Not choose this hotel.
Don__ be fooled by the rating. The room is extremely small I couldn__ even flat out my luggage in the room there__ no place to put my stuff at all. I travel to New York every couple months and this is the thinnest cubical tool I ever stayed. The air-com is loud n not cooling down. It__ annoy n hard to sleep. I__ very surprised of the high rating of this place because I don__ see any good from it. House keeping is not doing much either my bathroom floor towel was missing for two days. It__ super inconvenient. Keep telling me this is a boutique hotel any no improvement made to my total three + two nights stay as I booked two separate rooms.

Hi Frances, Thank you for taking the time to share your honest feedback with us. We are always looking for ways to grow and improve as a hotel and a brand. I want to apologize for the noisy A/C unit and the missing bathroom mat. These are things we can improve right away, so thank you for bringing these to our attention. As far as the size of the room, our hands are little tied. We do our best to be as transparent as possible when it comes to the small size of our guest rooms by providing floor plans, square footage, etc. We know they are not the spacious, but we hope that did not have too much of a damper on your time with us. Should you have a change of heart, we would love to host you again. Sincerely, - Benjamin Sebring | Director of Front Office"

I love the view, wide high windows a lot of natural lighting. Very clean and immaculate hotel with a committed staff centered on great customer service and professionalism. Arlo nomad has a boutique feel with an infusion of posh lavish accent. My only draw back there is elevators can take a while since there are only 2 for the higher floors. Aside from this, I__ recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a qualitative stay in heart of Manhattan.

OK for the money; would not book again.
The room and lobby were fine, but I felt the rooms were a lot smaller than the ones pictured online. Also, the lobby & hallways were very loud at all hours. The elevator calling system was not helpful, as it bottlenecked a bunch of people in a small hallway area waiting for their elevator to come, and sometimes the elevator would not come for up to 5 minutes.

Thank you Carly!
This hotel was awesome for our one night stay, but we easily could__e stayed longer. I booked a queen bed with a city view, but the picture on Hotels.com wasn__ the same as the actual room. When I went back to the desk to inquire, Carly explained the mix up and switched us over to a king room with the beautiful giant windows. She could__e told us to shove it and take it up with Hotels.com but she was so nice and understanding. If it weren__ for her (and the amazing windows for walls) I wouldn__ be writing this review. When we left our bags after check out Caroline was very sweet and informative. We didn__ get a chance to check out the roof top bar but the 2nd floor lounge was lovely. You have to tap your key to get into the elevator (and it automatically connects to your floor) which made us feel very safe. The valet was only $65 for 24 hours which is the best deal I__e ever seen in NYC for parking. Overall a great hotel with excellent staff in an awesome location. Will 100% stay again.

First of all, the staff demonstrates the best customer service I have ever experienced in a hotel. First time in NYC they were very helpful in getting around the city via double decker tour busses and the subways. Originally we were booked in a room on the 4th floor and then we were upgraded to a room on the 29th floor without additional charges. The location was perfect for our vacation. Walking distance to Times Square, The Empire State Building and subway train stations. I would recommend this hotel to all of my friends and to those who are reading this review.

My son loved the bank bed. Despite basic concept, the room is built with quality materials, nice design with excellent craftsmanship. Because of this, it leaves the impression of being luxurious. The lobby is well designed and looks nice. There was an event at the night we moved in and it looked a bit overcrowded. The area in front of the elevators is tiny and claustrophobic. If there is more than 2 people - it is overcrowded! The rooftop bar is nice and cozy. Unfortunately, they do not serve anything suitable for kids.

Air conditioning was broken. This was a big problem as our visit was during summer. Service came twice to fix this. WE spent way too much time dealing with this situation. I had asked on the first service visit if we could move and were told no vacancies. That was NOT true, as we were moved later after the second service call (which was late at night). We were finally given drink vouchers which weren't helpful, as we were leaving early the next morning. Room was tiny, (felt like a cruise ship room) and I hit my head on TV next to bathroom door. I would NOT stay here again.

a bit disappointing...
It was a bit disappointing. We had paid extra for a terrace and when we got there,cwe were informed that there was not a terrace room available. Also, one of the reasons I had booked that hotel was for the rooftop terrace. We were informed that it was closed for the night for a private party. They bought a round of drinks for us to try and make up for it, but it was the experience we wanted, not the drinks. Otherwise, the staff was very friendly and the room was clean.

It is centrally located, so it's easy to get around. My room was a bunk room, which was very small. It was also away from the other guest rooms and next to the elevator bank and utility rooms. The thermostat was at 68 degrees, which was very cold.

standard rooms are super small, you will need to pay extra to get the bigger rooms. The place is clean, staff are friendly, and love the happy hour. There is a $35 per night hotel cost to pay at time of check in, so i guess that includes your unlimited drinks during happy hour and the free wifi :)

The hotel has more style than substance. I can see the appeal for some, but it felt lacking as compared to the Public or other better executed modular hotels. The room we had was poorly conceived of and designed. The AC constantly cycled on and off due to the size of the room; the pillows were horrible and the shower curtain did not even reach the other side of the opening it intended to cover. Our room was not ready at check in, but we were comped a breakfast. Service was amiable, but we simply did not want to use the amenity spaces. The pictures make the hotel seem larger and brighter than it really is.

Yes, the rooms are tiny, yes, the elevators can be a long wait... but we felt so welcomed and taken care of the entire time that the little things don't bother me. The massive floor to ceiling windows make it feel roomy and it's 100% worth getting a sky view room so do it!!

Definitely not a 4 star hotel
Although this hotel gets great reviews, I would consider staying elsewhere. It's definitely not comparable to a 4 star hotel standard. I'll start with the positives: The best thing about the Arlo Nomad are the views from the rooftop terrace and the sky rooms. I suspect that those who book one of the other rooms would not have good views. The rooms were also very clean and the staff I interacted with were nice. The finishings in the hotel room are poor at best. It's as if they put minimal effort and money into designing and furnishing the rooms. To be honest, it reminded me of uni accommodations. The towels were the cheapest quality they are able to get away with, and the bed was far from comfortable. The only word to describe the bathroom is 'functional'. The whole hotel has a 'uni accommodation'/hostel vibe...definitely not something I look for in a hotel. I'm honestly confused about how this hotel managed to get a 4.6 rating, perhaps some of the reviews are fake? It isn't even close to a 4 star hotel (I'd say 3 star is a more accurate rating). There are far better hotels at a similar price point in Manhattan - don't be fooled by the photos on the site or the rating.

I love the scent they used when you walking in the door. I asked then aboit it and they have it for sale. And i love how they set up the place. Not that big but it has appeal. Plus the saff are very helpful and friendly Its in a good location too. I would recomend this place to people i know.

The pictures of the rooms are totally different from what you actually paid for, don__ have problem paying the price but this property definitely does not worth this price.super small rooms overpriced.

Hello Danny, Thank you for your honest and straight-forward feedback on your recent stay. We are deeply saddened that your stay was not all that you hoped it would be. For any inconveniences you may have experienced, we sincerely apologize. We've just looked at the booking engine on Expedia.com and there is notation of the daily resort fee published on the website in the reservation details, however, we could have done a better job of explaining this to you during your arrival experience. Again, we apologize for this oversight and for the inconvenience will address those charges accordingly. We'd also like to thank you for mentioning the faulty shower curtain. Our maintenance team will look into this and be certain it's fixed, although it may not directly affect your past stay, having it mentioned here, helps the next guest that will occupy this guest room. Thank you for bringing it to our attention. Should you have a change of heart, our doors will always be open to welcome you back with open arms. Warmly, Mateo Smith | Night Manager"

The room is smaller than a standard bathroom. Hotel desk staff said ""This is a boutique, sir. All the rooms are like this"". Great. $375 for one night in a bathroom-size room. No, thank you very much. When you get in the bed, you cannot get out without stepping over your partner. Hopeless is one word. Way overpriced is another. Ripoff is a third. The desk staff was kind enough to throw in breakfast for the two of us. Not enough to get over my disappointment. Hyatt that night was charging $250 with a much larger room and better amenities. The room in the Arlo did not even have an end table. You would bump your head against the TV if you are not careful. 4-star for this? I don't know what the world is coming to!

Cool vibe, but definitely not worth the price
I booked a sky view room with two-side windows after seeing photos of the scenery. To my biggest disappointment, the views were terrible on my side of the corner; make sure to be assigned a room with good view when you check in. The room is ridiculously small and without complimentary items you would normally find in a hotel priced this high - and the hotel itself is located in the middle of construction making it worse. The AC was so loud as well. Overall will never stay at this hotel chain.

Location, rooftop bar, view from room and simple design were great. Cost was on par with other places in the area, but still an awful lot for what you get. Not a fan of $30/night fee that was tacked on to the Expedia price at checkout, that seems disingenuous. Small bank of elevators means up to 10 minutes to go from room to lobby at certain times of day

The location is great but their elevator system needs work. The rooftop bar takes priority leaving hotel guests waiting way too long while rooftop non-guests ride up and down without delay. All hotel ad pictures show floor to ceiling windows and despite paying for an upgrade to a higher floor, our room did not have floor to ceiling windows.

The location and staff are great. However, the rooms advertised as queen are definitely double/full beds, which was not a comfortable sleeping situation for two tall adults. Additionally, the queen room that we were in did not even have a real bathroom door, just a glass barn door that meant there was a couple of inches of open space__hich would be fine for one person, but with two it was a level of intimacy we were not seeking.

Staff on training at front desk should have a __raining tag_ to make it clear to guests that they are not fully knowledgeable or capable to answer questions. Elevators was a disaster, too much waiting time and traffic.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Arlo NoMad. Upon arrival around 7am we were welcomed and given vouchers for coffee while our bags were taken off us. The staff also arranged for us to have an early check-in and let us know when our room was ready. After a sleeper fight and dealing with jet-lag this level of service could not have been more welcome. We remained very happy with the service throughout our stay. It was also a wonderful location to use as a base to explore NYC. The rooftop bar was a lovely added bonus. We can't recommend this hotel highly enough!

I paid for a terrace room and only booked this hotel to use expedia points. I was given a non-functioning terrace--couldn't open. Management offered to let me move rooms the next day, but only after I complained. I already unpacked. Do not offer a terrace room if it isn't working. I would like my expedia points back. This is as much of a complaint about expedia. This room should not have been offered if not functioning properly. I would have booked the Bowery50 and gotten points from Hyatt. Management not only didn't give a VIP upgrade, but they gave a non-functioning room. I'm sure they hoped I wouldn't say anything. I was working. I was already unpacked. The room was nice, but with no terrace, small. In addition, the construction noise is extemely loud. Expedia, you should refund my points!

The view from my room was nice and the very small room had some charm. There was a particularly kind staff person who brought coffee to my room in the morning--even though this $400+ a night hotel actually did not provide simple room service. Otherwise it was drab and unpleasant, considering the price. Once there I looked online to see how it was described on other sites and saw that a $170 a night deal was being offered. If I was paying $170 a night it would've been a lot more palatable.

Nice hotel in a very convenient Midtown location. I was fortunate to get a room with a bit of a view. Not the largest room I__e ever stayed in, but it wasn__ the smallest, either. Everything worked well, and I didn__ have any problems with noise.

We had a hardware malfunction and this hardware needed to be replaced. As a result the WiFi was down for 6 floors in the hotel.

Hello Roger, Thank you for leaving your feedback, it is very much appreciated.We genuinely appreciate all the feedback that we can get. It helps us learn in which areas we can grow and improve to provide better overall guest satisfaction. Looks like your experience was a bit of a mixed bag. The service was good at the Front Desk, but the bar service was severely lacking. First, I wanted to apologize for this less than stellar service. I definitely appreciate you letting us know about the poor service from the bartenders. I have forwarded your feedback to our Food and Beverage Managers and they will take appropriate action. We are in a transition period with our restaurant and bar options as we also noticed the lack of appropriate service and food options. We hope that you are able to visit the hotel in the near future and try out the rooftop bar and the new restaurant, which will serve Mediterranean cuisine in June. Thanks for staying with us and giving Arlo a chance. Safe Travels, Amil Deljanin Director of Front Office"

A really nice new find in NYC. Clean, contemporary, comfortable. Smallish rooms but I just needed to sleep there! Great location, excellent value. I will stay here again, for sure. Only little thing is elevators to the higher floors can take a while, but small price to pay for a great stay in NY.

This hotel was very disappointing as rooms are tiny and there was no possibility of upgrading to a larger room. Also, there aren't enough elevators, so one frequently has to wait for long.

Hello there, Thank you for taking the time out of your day to leave us a review. We believe every guest experience can teach us something new.

Resort Fees aren't merited
I resent the ""Resort Fee"" they don't advertise, but add $32/night to ""pay for wifi and other services. It's a shell game and sucks. Especially as there was construction and restaurant wasn't operational.

We do apologize that your visit came during our renovations but we are excited about what's coming and have no doubt that should you return, you'll enjoy the new Food & Beverage Outlets and our ever-popular Rooftop Lounge. We should mention that the Resort Fee is detailed in the booking of reservations on Hotels.com. We apologize if this information was not plainly accessible when you were making the reservation. We will look into this and make sure it's published plainly so that it doesn't come as a surprise in the future. Thanks once more for your candid feedback.

Over all very good!
Over all a nice hotel. Really good location for all the big sights and lots of good places to eat for breakfast and dinner including lots of Korean. Room was very clean and bright and a lovely modern bathroom however no draws which was slightly annoying. Headboard was very squeaky and bed not the softest but that__ just personal preference. Also, the hotel is opposite a large building site so if you want a relaxing lie in past 8:30am it__ not recommended- or perhaps ask for a room on the back it may be quieter than ours on the front. Of course you__e not in a big city so noise is to be expected but still something to bare in mind. Overall all really nice and modern and new and good value for NYC prices

Went there for our 25th wedding anniversary and we picked the property because it had a rooftop bar/lounge. We get there and asked if we could check in a few hours early but were told our room was not ready, but that we could go to a different room and then move to our room the next day. We didn't want to deal with moving rooms in the middle of our stay so we declined and said we would wait until 3pm (the check in time) and asked how to get to the rooftop area to grab a drink and wait and were told it was closed until May due to construction. Imagine our sincere disappointment since that was one of the main reasons we picked this property. Not once during the reservation process or follow up emails or on their website were we told the rooftop was closed. Already disappointed we left to find something to eat while we waited. They took our info down to call or email to let us know when our room was ready. Never got a call or email. We came back to the hotel at 3pm and again were told our room wasn't ready. Again imagine our disappointment when check in is 3pm and our room is not ready. Mind you these rooms are extremely small, about 150 SF, so hard to imagine it would take past check in time to have it ready. For all of our disappointment we were given 2 complimentary drink tickets. Considering it was our 25th anniversary and the key component of our stay at this hotel was not available, it felt like it was a very weak attempt to mitigate the situation.

Hi there, I want to thank you for taking the time to write your review and share your feedback with us! We have continual meetings in regards to the feedback we receive in these reviews. I want to apologize for the lack of communication on our end regarding our rooftop closure and construction. We know our rooftop space is a major component and draw to the hotel. We are a micro-concept hotel, so square footage is quite limited. We know that we unfortunately do not offer the most spacious of accommodations. Congratulations on 25th years together, and may you continue to celebrate for years to come. Warmly, - Benjamin Sebring | Assistant Front Office Manager"

I spent 6 nights in this hotel and the overall experience was amazing! It was a tiny hotel yet the design utilizes every inch of the space which which you feel much more roomier. The hotel room was spotless and the hardware is new. It is conveniently located in midtown Manhattan. The neighborhood was, like what you can expect in most parts in Manhattan, not the tiniest yet it offers everything you needed.

Hello there, Thank you for taking the time out of your day to leave us your feedback. While I'm glad that you enjoyed most of your stay, I'm sorry that your stay wasn't perfect. I wish you would have told us about the noisy AC in your room and we would have tried our best to alleviate your concerns by working on the unit or moving you to a quieter room. Thank you for staying with us, I hope that you're able to visit again in the future. Safe travels, Amil Deljanin Director of Front Office"

Great location, great hotel. Worst comment I could make was regarding the shampoo dispenser pumps. In other words, there was nothing to complain about and we immensely enjoyed our stay.

We loved our four-night stay here! Great location, modern hotel, and friendly staff. They have an Urban Fee, but it includes wifi on unlimited devices and a daily wine hour with light snacks. There's also a rooftop, but the weather wasn't the best while we were there so we didn't hang out up there. There's a restaurant on the 1st floor that I heard good things about, but we didn't eat there on this trip. The rooms are small, but they are an efficient use of space and we did not spend much time in our room.

Prior to my stay at the hotel I was in contact with the host Angie, as i had a night out planned to get engaged to my long time girlfriend. She was extremely helpful with planning our return from a long night out. They went out of their way to make this night extra special by going out and picking up all of my requested amenities and than setting up the room while we were out. I appreciate all the staff who were involved, including my girls doing the overnight shift when we returned, very cool people. Obviously the staff was amazing, I've stayed at many hotels in Manhattan and I've never had the experience I've had with the staff they were all great. As for the room, it was smaller but perfect, very comfortable with a beautiful view. Shower was a blessing. When I'm in the area I will definitely be staying here again.

Friendly and helpful staff, there was a numerous occassions where the staff helped us so much. The room had an amazing room as expected and the unique smell of the hotel was lovely. We had a friend stayed in this hotel before and she too loved the smell which is a unique thing to remember and take away. The room and the hotel facilities were immaculate very very clean. The only thing that would of made our stay even better would have been to supply us with bottles of water in the room. When we first arrived her had complimentary water in the room thinking these would be replaced daily when the rooms were getting cleaned but they didnt which was disappointing as at night before bed is when i usually take water and i didnt want to have to constantly to remind myself when out to purchase water. Also when I looked up the reviews where other people stayed at the hotel for a special occasion the hotel did a special welcome in the room for some of their guests. As such before arriving i wanted to double check the sky room we had booked was what we were receiving and to inform them that it was my partners 40th birthday. Upon arriving this was not acknowledged which was disappointing especially when they have done it for other guests.

Cool modern feeling hotel. Issue with the $30 amenity fee that is really not clearly advertised. Please just say your hotel actually costs $280 per night (not $250). We did not use any amenities either. We did not attend the happy hour, did not even use the wifi!! Either nickle and dime us once we get there or tell us the hotel costs 30$ more per night instead of charging me when I leave. It feels sneaky and immoral. I would rather pay for what I actually use.

V good location for walking to Empire State building/mid town NY. Clean room, small. Great level 2 bar and work area (FOC happy hour drinks and nibbles for guests daily). Big light, bright windows but blockout shades. Fridge in room but no jug, etc. Top floor bar looks like it would be nice in summer, but it's closed in Winter. Room is small. No robes provided. No wardrobe: just a few hangers. Design if show means whole bathrooms floor gets wet which is bad design and super annoying for using bathroom thereafter.

We booked a Sky view room, and to our surprise there was a Huge Wall right in front of our window, from the building next to it. It was nothing what the pictures on the site shows. Room was super tiny, but clean. Front desk staff was very friendly. I would not want to stay here again, going by so many other options in Manhattan.

We had a fun and convenient stay at the Arlo! We had full size bunkbeds and my two girls made the room into a girls trip sleepover! The staff was very pleasant and accommodating and there is a beautiful roof view. The location is easy to hop and hop off the metro or even walk to Times Square and other sites. Arlo will be our go to hotel!!!!

the hotel__ design is really great & aesthetically pleasing. the room is really clean, but it__ really compact. i brought a 2 sided luggage & the room does not have any space to open it so i had to store it under the bed. i guess that__ the only downside of this hotel. the location of the hotel is amazing! it__ really near to soho, flatiron, & korea town.

Home away from home
The Arlo Nomad is my home away from home in NYC! I work in the Empire State Building so the location is great. Near to Nomad area too, which is nice for shopping and eating. The rooms are *very* small but nicely designed and always very clean. The lobby is nice and the upstairs library room is BEAUTIFUL. The service level is not like a fancier hotel, sometimes they seem very busy and it's not quite as buttoned up, but the staff is always really nice and treats you personally so the few times I've had an issue they've always been great about sorting it out. I think the Arlo chain is a hidden gem.

Very urban, super clean & great location. The bunk room is kinda awkward as the bathroom door is cut off on the top and bottom, so you see right through and also smell whatever is happening in the bathroom!!! I also thought booking through Expedia would save me money at this hotel however, they get you with the __rban Fees_ at the end, so I may as well of booked directly through Arlo NoMad website. Apart from that, the stay was epic!

Fantastic new modern hotel for exploring NYC
This was our second stay at the Arlo Nomad and it didn__ disappoint. The location is perfect for exploring New York and has lots of restaurants nearby plus only a short walk to Subway stations. The hotel is very modern with fantastic communal spaces plus a rooftop bar with great views when open in the warmer months. Like most NYC hotels the rooms are small but have been thoughtfully designed to maximise the use of space. The beds are super comfortable and the showers hot and powerful. We had a quiet room high up on floor 22 with a fantastic view of the Empire State Building. We will definitely stay here again when we next visit and highly recommend.

Convenient, no frills, best for short stays
Convenient location and great staff downstairs. Overall no frills for the rooms and very small, even upgraded rooms, quick paint jobs (wall paint on shelves and closet in my room, which isn't an issue but just a bit sloppy overall). Elevator is slow - which is fine, and expected in a lot of NYC buildings - but guests were complaining regularly every time I was in the elevator so plan accordingly. Rooms are very tiny and not well set up - shower curtain not sized right so the bathroom floods when the water is on; easy to bump into closet/shelves and difficult to walk around the bed. Also doesn't seem like there is housekeeping regularly, maybe it has to be requested. Works well for a short stay crash pad but not ideal if you're looking to spend time in the hotel. Small conveniences like water in the rooms, cups, etc. would go a long way.

Arlo Nomad.... second stay was horrible
I stayed at the Arlo Nomad about 6 months ago and had a wonderful experience. However my latest experience was not that great. I was never told of the new amenities ( it added another $175 to my bill that I was unaware of), my room was freezing. They did bring me a space heater but every time you turned it on it smelt like it was about to burn up. I was woken up by the cleaning crew at 630am two times and I had to deal with engineers coming into my room to take measurements. All and all bad stay this time around.

The modern vibes, the hassle free check in and quick resolution to problems, rooms were clean and although very (*very) small equipped w all most important amenities. The only areas of improvment is the Arlo Cafe located in the hotel lobby, the cafe did not offered many breakfast options (only cinnamon muffins were available both days we wanted to have brakfast in) coffes were overpriced (notwithstanding the 20% Off cupon offered to us at check in). With such ample choices of bars and cafe around, ArloNomad should do a better job in upgrading their coffee/pastries options.

The hotel is pretty nice. Small but you should expect it in New York. Paid extra for the sky view.. but the view wasn__ that great.. Both our windows were facing a building with construction . We asked if there were other rooms but they said, __very side is under construction, we should update our website._ We gave up, obviously they didn__ want to try switching. We went to ktown for dinner and on the way we realized that what they said weren__ true. Overall the night view was still good as we can__ really see the construction. Our anniversary would have been better if we actually got the better side.

It has a great location and the lobby and 2nd floor are very nice. The rooms are very small. They claim they__e a micro concept hotel but I didn__ see that in the property details on Expedia during my research. The bathrooms have limited privacy - just a sliding glass door. The bed was a little smaller than a normal queen bed. We were happy with the staff and the service, but next time we__e in town we__l probably stay elsewhere.

Upon arriving at the hotel I was greeted by the most friendly staff. The design is great and the overall vibe is cozy, cool, fresh and clean. The room was small but the view from my room was fantastic and expansive (corner room king on a high floor) which more than made up for it. I also loved the lobby cafe in morning for a latte.

This may have been the smallest hotel I__e ever stayed in. Granted there were only two of us, it was almost as if we couldn__ move about at the same time. The tv was in such an awkward position that we could have easily knocked of over with the bathroom door. Very challenging experience, but I assume the view was supposed to make up for that. We were also disappointed in the fact that our tv features did not work and there were no microwaves for public use (parents with babies steer clear). Nonetheless the hotel was good and the restaurant was decent. This location is in the heart of the city and pretty close to a number of great restaurants!

Arlo Nomad delivers!
Really enjoyed our stay, the hotel is beautiful, modern and in a great area. There are multiple subway stops nearby, and being in Korea Town there are plenty of restaurants nearby (2 of which are on the same street, both looked good). The hotel has a beautiful roof terrace with amazing views, and during the winter (at least when we visited in January) they had igloos on the roof with heaters, candles and comfy chairs, this was a really nice touch and it was surprisingly cosy inside. I can't say too much on the staff as we didn't get breakfast or food there, however the guys they have doing the luggage and other things are a credit to the hotel, friendliest staff by far. The hotel also has a small cafe in the lobby which is a nice touch, the coffee is better than your average american coffee but prices in general are a little steep. When staying in New York always remember that you'll be paying approximately 15% tax per night on top of your room fee, the hotel did not remind me that this charge would come from my card which would have been nice.

Loved every bit of it except the size of the room
Me and my wife went to New York City to celebrate Christmas and New Years. The moment we checked into this hotel, we were more than pleased with the entire vibe of the hotel. With the price we got, considering the location of this hotel, we weren__ expecting much but the moment we entered we loved the hospitality they offered. There were Christmas vibes, free wine and champagne, light nibles and ofcourse the giant Christmas tree. The guest services team were at point with their services and they helped us with a lot of things around. We got our keys and moved into our room. We had booked a city view room with a king size bed. Considering the amount of bags we had, we felt the room was little cramped up and it hardly had any city view besides the crossing street and the buildings opposite. To be honest, we expected much more from the size of the room but we had to manage with what we had. The rooftop was amazing although the bar was shut. But they had cute little igloos set up in winter on the rooftop and I personally felt that was really nice. Ideally I would give 5/5 for everything they had but just because of the size of the room I would give it a 4

The spot is perfect. You__l walk all over Manhattan wherever you stay, but this was located very close to Empire State, the Rockefeller, and things that were on my list such as 230 fifth rooftop bar and Rolf__. The lobby was tastefully decorated in the christms spirit and the free wine from 530pm-7pm was a brilliant touch for the wearied traveller. The ONLY issue I had was that our sky room didn__ fave the Empire State like pictures would have you believe - the the stunning roof top took care of that for me. Would definitely stay again.

Perfect central location for a Manhattan visit. Large 24 hour healthy food market around the corner, easy check in, extremely polite and helpful staff, very clean, check out time is noon so you can sleep in before your flight back home. That said, the rooms are TINY so make sure you you are traveling light (there is no room to open up a suitcase except on the bed) and comfortable with intimacy if you are sharing a room. There is ample space in the several common areas on the first two floors to stretch out. Seems to cater to a mostly younger crowd, although my wife and I (FAR from young) felt right at home. Good vibes.

Location is convenient. However we were disappointed with the property. Room is much smaller than it appears in the pictures. Our heating and shower were malfunctioning and the hotel engineer was unable to resolve it while we weren't offered a room change or anything. Be aware of the resort fee of 30$ a day which is excessive considering the lack of facilities. Happy hour might have been nice perks for some guests but was inconsiderate to underaged and pregnant guests. Barely any benefit through Expedia VIP access.

Awesome trip, great room and great location
The stay was amazing. We booked a city view queen and asked if they had anything with an empire states building view. At first they had nothing but then after a few clicks we were moved into an ADA room (much bigger!) with a view of the Empire State Building from our bed!! So amazing. Everyone was friendly and everything was clean. Would definitely stay again! Also a quick 15-20 minute walk up 5th ave to shopping and Central Park and a 15 minute walk downtown to Washington Square park. Area felt very safe!

Great hotel in a perfect location! Only 10 minute walk to MSG and Penn Station. We had an amazing room with a beautiful view of the Empire State Building and right in the heart of Korea Town. One of the staff members even suggested a wonderful brunch place when we arrived. They held our baggage until our room was ready and we were able to check in at 1pm instead of the usual 3pm. We will definitely be staying here again! The only small issue was the noise from the outside construction but it__ New York so that is normal. The air conditioner/ heater was also quite loud but nothing that could take away from the rest of our stay. Thank you!

We have loved our stay at the Arlo nomad. We were given an upgrade on arrival which was very much appreciated. The room was compact which we expected but very well thought out. The room was lovely, clean and modern and the views from the floor to ceiling windows were great. The only fault I could say was the very noisy fan in the room which came on intermittently but did not spoil our stay. We loved the location and the views from the rooftop were fantastic, especially of the Empire State Building. Staff were very friendly and nothing was a trouble to them.

We had a fabulous time celebrating my 50th bday with friends. The ice huts on the roof were amazing & provided gorgeous views of the Empire State Building! The staff was very friendly & the communal spaces were very hip & relaxing. The only problem was the service was very slow for brunch in Massoni restaurant, but the food was delicious. The rooms are also tiny but they did a great job with the limited space. I__ go back in a heartbeat. Wonderful memories & way to enjoy NYC during the holidays!

Additional fees were not explained during check-in. I only found out during my last day when I inquired about a charge on my credit card. The front desk took care of the charges as a gesture. Had I known from the beginning I would__e used all the amenities. I went out to purchase bottled water everyday not knowing there were free ones in the room. The elevator broke down the last night of our stay, but at check out the front desk was kind to refund me the last night of our stay. I also had requested for a reservation to Peter Lugers, but no one ever got back to me. There were some hits and misses with my stay at Arlo Nomad, but I would stay with them again as the location is unbeatable and the staff overall were great!

Great hotel location for short break
Great compact hotel offering with lots of good aspects. Staff very helpful. Reception and bar areas had a good atmosphere, quite different from a chain hotel and it had a cool/boutique vibe. Floor by floor it__ a small hotel but with only about 8 rooms per floor and super fast lifts you never have to walk far to your room. Rooms fresh and modern but very small.....no room to walk round the bed etc. Also our room was quiet as was back facing from the main road. Think it__ a good NYC option for a few nights but for a longer trip the size of room might be an issue for some.

Thank you for your review! I'm glad to hear that our staff was friendly and welcoming, that's exactly how we want them to make our guests feel! I'm sorry that the bathroom layout was not to your liking. Your comments are totally fair and understandable. Many hotels in New York use a similar bathroom design to help save space since space is so limited in New York! We have taken comments like this into account when designing new Arlo Hotels and we will eliminate the open bathroom concept from all future Arlo hotels. Thanks again for the review. We hope to welcome you back to Arlo Hotels in the future!"

The partnership with tone house is amazing - I wish there were more options that would have allowed me to take advantage of it!

The room is typically super tiny in nyc. You can__ take your suitcase out. Also there__ loud machine noise at night which could be disturbing. The interior is good and staffs are nice. Got awesome view on 28th floor. Room is clean and facilities are ok. The hotel is at great location which is good for me as well. But I__ not going again if I can__ use the coupon as this time too. Not an affordable price for the rooms with view.

We had the bunk bed room and though it was small, it was clean, and comfortable. The temperature controls worked well, keeping us comfortable on our trip. Love the large walk in shower with rain shower head and they provided a nice set of toiletries. It was a great home base for our trip to see the Macy__ Thanksgiving Day Parade. Just One block from the Empire State Building and an easy early morning walk (one block to 6th street and a few blocks up to move away from Herald Square) to great parade viewing.

This was our 2nd time staying at Arlo Nomad. First time we were very impressed and this time it was even better! Everyone working in the hotel is fantastic! Very professional and friendly but not over the top, loud or fake. Everyone seems very chill but makes for a relaxed atmosphere! Our room was awesome with view of the Empire State Building! Restaurants and lounges throughout the hotel are decorated beautifully. Location is the best, midtown, very easy to get uptown or downtown quickly. Overall an amazing experience! Will definitely be back again and will recommend to others travelling to NYC!

A lively and small hotel in the heart of Manhattan
It is a lively and small hotel in the heart of Manhattan. Liked the wine service in the lobby every evening. On the other hand, the rooms are extremely small even for a Manhattan hotel, so not very comfortable to be in except for sleep. Can't beat the price for the location. Overall, great value if you want to stay for 1-2 nights.

I love this hotel- the rooms are adorable and well appointed, and the staff has consistently gone above and beyond. Most recently, I was panicked trying to get to the airport during a rainstorm, and they managed to pull a few strings and get me there for half of what Uber was charging. They were so apologetic for my stress that they sent over a glass of Prosecco while I waited.

It was our first trip to NYC and I spent a lot of time looking for the perfect place. I came across Arlo NoMad, saw pictures of their rooms, affordable price (especially for what you get) and didn't hesitate. I ended up booking their King City View room but called them to inquire on how much it would be to upgrade to the SkyView a few times, and if there was one even available. My birthday and anniversary both fell on the week that I was staying at the hotel so I when I saw the SkyView online it just seemed perfect. I called right before our flight just to see if there was an available King SkyView room available and they let me know they went ahead and already upgraded my room for free. That left me speechless. They were already so kind up until that point and I was 100% not expecting it and was so excited. After arriving to the hotel, the check-in was a breeze, they were incredibly friendly, and since I was there very early, they held onto my bags while we went to the restaurant wait for the room to be available. When we walked into the room, it was perfect. Just enough space, super comfortable bed, a beautiful view and very minimalistic style. The hotel placement was convenient and overall just perfect. I couldn't have stayed at a more perfect hotel. What made this even more memorable is I became a fianc√© on their roof and felt like the Arlo staff was just as excited as I was that they seriously became family. Thank you all so much <3

Really enjoyed our stay! Staff were welcoming, helpful and friendly. Location was brilliant with Manhattan Mall and other stores a 6 minute walk away, and Times Square only a little further on foot. Great view of the Empire State Building from the roof-too bar too! Will definitely return and book a Sky room to enjoy the amazing view from the top of the hotel from our room!

Good stay -one ""extra"" charge to take note of.
Location is GREAT, honestly! Close to the highly trafficked tourist areas, but also close to local gems. We had a great time eating and visiting cocktail bars around the area. The rooftop is very nice here and the bar on the second floor. We didnt eat at the hotel restaurant, but its on a lot of 'must eat places' list so I bet its amazing. I give everything 5 starts, except the room size is a bit little. I don't think the hotel makes the rooms sound bigger than they are -but just something to keep in mind (also its NYC, so lets keep expectations in check; real estate is expensive). The one thing I didnt like was the 30 dollar urban fee for amenities I didn't use. I like it when hotels keep things simple and don't tack on extra fees. So please note for people who book through hotels.com, there is that charge. All in all, good stay!

Great location in midtown. Love the decor of the upstairs lounge. Friendly staff. A few complaints- we got a room right next to the elevator so I heard the clacking of the elevator all night and was too tired everyday to pack up and request a new room. The little clocks were missing from the wall. Our final night someone had marked us as an early checkout- so got woken up at 2am to a cleaner attempting to enter our room. Not so fun with a 5am wakeup call for the airport. The lady at the desk the next morning was very apologetic and sweet- not her fault. Nomad please consider changing that procedure! I would recommend based on location alone- try Open Kitchen around the corner for quick green smoothies and coffee. All in all- a great trip.

Great for one person.
The room I got was an upgrade from the originally booked room and it was super tiny. Although I didn't need much space, I was a bit surprised of the small size of the room and wondered how much smaller the room would have been if it wasn't upgraded. Also, the bathroom didn't have doors. So if a guest comes to your room, they'd have to use the bathroom without privacy. This was a bit odd... Anyway, i did like everything else about the Arlo. No complaints. Great location, service and vibe. But overall value was a bit high for what you get.

Really enjoyed this hotel. It was very clean staff was fantastic. We arrived early they stored our luggage for us than called us when our room was ready. At checking out they stored our luggage again so we could enjoy our day until we were leaving later that evening. The views from our room were amazing. It is at a good location in Mid town. Views of the Empire State building from our room. The only thing they could improve is to get outside heaters for the roof top bar so it could be open in the cooler temps. It was closed which was disappointing but you could get access to the roof to see the amazing views.. We will return for sure.

Cramped closet size room
Front desk service was friendly and decent. Elevators were super slow with many maintenance workers sharing and outside guests using to go to rooftop bar on weekend. They said they put me on a high floor, as if that was doing a favor but would have been better if staying lower to save time. Also, checked in early and bags were never brought up to room because front desk was understaffed and/or busy, until I went down to retrieve, then they finally apologized and brought up. Rooms are size of closet and cramped with no view, with no place to open luggage, and bathroom was basically as soon as you walk into room with sink on one side and toilet and shower on the other. Decor in hotel was trying a bit hard to appeal to millennials.

Calpton Weekend at Arlo Nomad
It was really amazing. The only and I mean only complaint was the room was very cramped. I also don't know why hotels never have shower doors. The decor is fun and creative. The library area upstairs is adorable. I didn't make it to the rooftop bar as my stay was brief. I love that they have the grab and go food and beverage area 24 hours. The location was perfect. I was able to walk to Madison Square Garden in ten minutes.

Good hotel worth it if you are lucky.
Everything was good. Only reason why i didnt give 5 star is because i expcted better views for the price i paid. I saw pictures on social media and booked this hotel which had amazing views. This hotel is 30 stories high and the skyline view room i got was on 19th floor next to a construction zone. View wasnt all that great. I personally dont think it was worth almost $500 bucks a night for this view. It wouldve been worth it if i was on the other side of the hotel at around 25th floor with empire state building view. I wish i was on the other side...

Good, but not great
It's a hip hotel and very clean. Good people working there. The location is okay, but not great. I've stayed in a lot of NYC hotel rooms, and while none of them are spacious, these rooms are TINY, as is everything about this hotel. I was just staying a night on business, so it suited my needs. I might stay here again, but only if I was traveling alone and on business.

Disliked: Staff & service, property conditions & facilities, room comfort
Ultra design-y style prevents comfortable stay.
FIRST: Ventilation A/C cycled in and out all night really loud like a jet engine. We were unable to adjust it using thermostat. We got no sleep! This is a case where the ultra design looks great on an interior design drawing, but fails in real life. There is no place to put down your purse, wallet, watch, glasses, coffee cup, etc. because there are NO tables of any kind. So we put our stuff on the floor. There is a cubby hole where we could put a small suitcase, but it was below clothes hangers, so we had to choose one or the other. There is a very large open cabinet above this, but guests would need a ladder to use it. There is NO private bath ROOM -- just an area, divided off by a smoked glass divider, open at the top. The bath sink bowl is very large (very design-y), but the edges are very narrow, no countertop for toiletries, so there is no safe place to put razors, toothpaste, brushes, etc. without them falling into the huge sink. There was no hot water in the sink. When taking a shower, the hot water only lasted a few minutes, then it got gradually cooler. I guess they are trying to be ""green"" by limiting the hot water? Very large bed, right next to the window and the wall, and only accessible from one side, so the person nearest the window must climb over the other person to get out of the bed.

Great hotel with good restaurant and roof bar.
This is a wonderful hotel with a great restaurant and roof top bar. It was in a good location for us as it was mostly a trip for business, but easily accessible to uptown. The rooms are SMALL. My one complaint is that there was not enough space for our luggage. We each had only an overnight case and we had to put them in the floor and we were constantly stepping over them.

Amazing views
We stayed in a Queen Sky View room at Arlo Nomad. The staff were all very helpful and the location is great. The sky view itself was fantastic - a real treat to sit in bed and stare out across New York. The room was quite small, but it had everything you need. We stored our suitcases under the bed which helped keep things together. The roof terrace bar offers yet more stunning views, but comes at the cost of quite expensive drinks. Overall I would recommend Arlo Nomad if the aforementioned cons aren't a big deal to you.

We liked the Scandinavian feel, well designed rooms that fits all required needs into a fairly small space. ROoms don't feel small because of large windows. Everything is new and clean. It's an experience, not just a hotel. - and in a great location. We saw two shows and two museums in two days with ease.

Great location by k-town, but had maybe the most frustrating experience with their elevator. They should either have more/bigger ones. The wait time was 5-10mins every time I had to go up. Room had a smaller feel than expected. Didn't realise that the sink would just be in the room and that the toilet/shower area was only blocked off by a layer of glass. Otherwise, the interior design of the hotel in general was quite nice and I was able to sleep well.

Check it out, start with the rooftop
Good choice, though many good options in the area. Rooms small but well designed, floor to ceiling windows help, excellent common areas for meetings etc and perhaps the best roof deck around. Extensive and high quality food and coffee selection in the lobby is a real advantage. Only downsides are fault of the building design- desperately needs 1-2 more elevators, hvac is very loud for a new hotel, and glass on shower wall is a little too translucent if traveling with kids.

A very clean hotel with modern furnishings, etc. The rooms although small are comfortable, especially for a solo traveler. The particular location in Manhattan is not the best (e.g., homeless sleeping some twenty paces or so from the hotel's front door, strong odors of refuse near the same), but I can't say that I ever felt unsafe. The main downside in my view is no room service, although a very good restaurant exists in the hotel. Also, one may find oneself waiting awhile for an available elevator.

Rooms too small for me, Otherwise Good
This review is for the room only. Had a good sandwich at the restaurant, and the bar is good. The rooms are too small. This is my 2nd time staying here and decided to try it again, but don't a third time. If you're alone and/or busy in the city then this will be fine but I prefer more space. Also, the TV in my room was on a very poorly placed stand next to the bathroom door. I couldn't fit anything in the bathroom, so I had my bag next to the door. I reached down to get something, stood up, and cracked my head into the tv. Left a huge mark that people at work asked me about. After that, I felt like I had to be careful moving around the room. Also, no desk, I needed to work for a few hours and would prefer a desk. I will not stay again.

Small but clean, contemporary, and well-located
I did not realize this was considered a micro-boutique hotel. But I travelled alone and for one person, the room, albeit small, was very clean and had a contemporary design. In addition, the staff was always upbeat and the overall hotel vibe was positive. If I were to nitpick, the room lacked drawers for your clothing. Given the price vs. value, the overall was excellent.
Pros: See above.
Cons: See above.
Location: I basically travelled in the midtown area.

The Arlo Nomad was an overall good experience. I was upgraded to a room with a great view of the Empire State Building. It ended up being a handicap room, so I think I actually had more space than a normal room. The elevator situation isn't great...seems like it ALWAYS took far longer than you'd expect for an elevator to show up unless it was LATE night. My stay was during a crazy hot time (90*+) and the street outside and to the West smelled TERRIBLE. Nothing the hotel can control really, but a reality of that spot. Overall I enjoyed the stay and probably will stay there again.

Unique and cute hotel
The staff was personable and the hotel is nice. NYC hotel rooms are expected to be tiny but my room was especially small, with barely enough room for the bed. It was still comfortable but I wouldn't have wanted to do it for more than one night. I also arrived during peak rooftop hours and it took about 15 minutes to get to my floor. Had someone explained the elevator system better, I would have gotten up a lot quicker. I also was intrigued by the rooftop yoga the next morning but was unsure how to book it. It should be promoted more!

Overall good. I had requested that the room have no feathers prior to check in, but that was not done and it took a while to get it done. Given late check in after long day and flight the last thing I wanted to do was wait 2 hours for room to be put in order. Elevators took forever...which is fine but had to go up and down to front desk 5 times and each ride was 5 minute wait at least.

We were really excited to stay at Arlo NoMad after reading an article about its concept of space-efficient rooms, but the experience turned out to be uncomfortable and I hope the hotel can address these pain points. 1. Air conditioner was extremely noisy. It might be because the building is old, but it was so loud that I had trouble falling asleep. 2. The elevator system seems to have a serious security problem - even thought it's equipped with room card scanners, you can actually request to go to any floor. This is not so problematic if not for the fact that the rooftop bar is open to the public and is very popular, and anyone visiting the bar or getting back down from it can come to any of the guest room floors. 3. It was not clear at all how to operate the bathroom's vent, or if it's always on. What's worse - the front desk couldn't tell us what the situation is with the vent when I called it! 4. Shower curtain malfunctions - it's a cute design, but it leaves a large gap above head level, and water spills out easily. 5. This was awful: the notice in the room said that if I hang my towels then they won't be replaced by new towels by the cleaners (I think it said I actually had to call them to request new ones), which I was glad to do since I'm very very conscious of the environmental cost of hospitality. BUT they gave us a new set of towels the next day anyways!! What a waste and confusion!

Clean & cozy for solo traveler
Would definitely stay here again! The microroom was clean, minimalistic and cozy. My room on the 9th floor was very quiet. I brought family and friends to the restaurant any everyone enjoyed the food (it was a bit dark though). Hotel staff was great, they even held my bag for a few hours after checkout and offered me an umbrella so I could walk around in the rain before leaving NYC. Great energetic vibe too.

Hello Andrew, Thank you for sharing your feedback! We are delighted to hear you enjoyed your trip, aside from the elevator delays. Unfortunately, we do experience delays with only have two high rise elevators. We hope this does not have a huge impact if guests are able to plan extra commute time. We are very sorry that this so negatively impacted your time with us. We hope to welcome you back for another visit, and can recommend reserving a room on floors 8 or lower which you give you access to our low rise elevator, experiencing much fewer delays. We hope this will prove more fitting to your needs! Warm Regards, Carly Antonioli Assistant Front Office Manager"

front desk was fine but when I was in elevator it stopped on 2nd floor and a hotel staff member tried to get someone with large trash bin to come in with guests in elavator. We all gave her strange looks and she someone changed her mind about putting large trash bin in elevator with hotel guests. On the way back when we stopped on 2nd floor that same staff member was rude to everyone by ordering us all to move over to the right... The room is modern and new but it is extremely small and the shower was not comfortable. Did not feel comfortable in the room or hotel... The hotel rate is very high for what you get.

Hotel is cool, modern, comfortable, excellent service. Elevators can be jammed and long wait. Base room was TINY, though very elegantly designed. I'd stay there alone for one or two nights but if you want to work or spread out at all, pretty small. With a couple... you'll want to spend all your time in bed. Rooftop bar is beautiful ($15 for a Gin & Tonic in a plastic cup) and worth a visit for the views.

Fine hotel given that I only stayed there to enjoy the air conditioner when mine broke. That said, the TV was broken, the room was small even by NYC standards, and in front of the hotel was more trash than I__e recently seen on a Manhattan street. I enjoyed the air conditioning but wouldn__ recommend this hotel to anyone on a expense account; your dollar can go further elsewhere.

This place should be advertised as a tiny room! Do not bring a big piece of luggage or 2 people's normal luggage. Liked the check-in process but there are too many people going up the elevators. At least it's very quiet. If you don't mind having the bath in the bedroom & a very small bed area,then it's ok. Modern, updated.

Pretty good but room for improvement
For the price, location and quality of room, this is not a bad deal. Room is small, was expected when I see the description before booking, around 150sqft. But Air condition is pretty loud, elevator is slow because of lots floor, and people going to rooftop bar. Sink in the room has the faucet on the left side, which is inconvenient.

Dreamy boutique hotel in the middle of it all
Stay here! I was skeptical because I usually go with big chain hotels but the price was right with this one. Omg the place is beautiful inside out. A total boutique place and a rooftop bar on the 31st floor. The room had amazing amenities like a steamer instead of iron, tv for each of the bunkbeds, and even a view of the Empire State Building. There are two gorgeous restaurants at the hotel, too. Nothing could have made my stay better! Also, it__ newish construction so all the carpet and floors and walls are fresh and not worn like other older places.

Modern, snug space with great location + vibes
This is a really fun, hip hotel. The rooms are cozy and snug, but great for one person on a business trip. Fresh and modern decor, great city views, and a fridge in the room which is always nice. The hotel itself has an incredible (and trendy) rooftop lounge and a neat restaurant and coffee/ice cream stand in the lobby. Great service, fantastic location, and all-around nice place to stay. Would stay again!

Our room was the perfect size for 2 people but if we had had anymore we would__e been crammed, but in NYC your room is just for sleeping. Great experience and price was WAY reasonable for the quality. Would recommend to anyone looking for a hip place to stay in a great part area of the city!

Great location but beware of long elevator wait
The hotel was nice and the location was great. Two issues: one, the rooms are VERY small (we knew this going in) and second, the elevators took close to 10 minutes to come up to our floor in the morning.

Compact and close but lacking
Whilst it is a nice hotel in Korea Town if you get a room at the rear of the building there isn__ much to recommend. You would think that there might be some additional element to compensate with being in. a tiny room only 6 foot away from the building at the rear ( so a dark hole with no view to speak of) but there wasn__. (Free breakfast etc) Room could have done with a full length mirror ( it could have been accommodated easily on the spare wall next to the bathroom). Booking 10 months in advance with Expedia didn__ really get any bonuses. Shame. Also roof top bar was let out to private parties in the evening so for two of our days it wasn__ available.

Best rooftop views of Midtown. The room we stayed had the two floor to ceiling windows and had a breathtaking view. The staff is fantastic and super friendly. We came here for a 4th of July party on the rooftop bar, which was an experience all on its own. They have a small section of the rooftop bar that is seethrough so you can look down to the city. Highly recommend staying here!

Loved this hotel. The interior decor and aesthetic is totally hip and tastefully done. The room I stayed in had an incredible view of the city! I also enjoyed all the amenities - rooftop bar and second floor lounge were awesome spots to relax and grab a drink with friends in the area. My only negative feedback would be to improve elevator traffic. The rooftop is popular among locals and hotel guests alike, so expect a long wait when calling one if you__e trying to leave. The hotel is walking distance to Koreatown and the Flatiron District. Lots of great bars and restaurants to go to when exploring the city! Would definitely stay here again!

Fabulous Hotel in Midtown Manhattan
I have stayed at the Arlo NoMad several times in the past year, and each stay keeps getting better and better. The staff are very friendly and helpful, and I appreciate that they remember me from previous visits. Rooms in this hotel are very small; however, they are functional. I usually travel alone, and I find the rooms to be a comfortable size for me. My only complaint would be the elevators take awhile to come, especially during peak hours when non-guests are traveling to and from the rooftop bar. The rooms are very tidy and minimalist. I particularly like staying at the Arlo NoMad because it is a very central location, and the subway at 34 St & Broadway is just a few blocks away. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling in New York and wanting a central, modern and comfortable hotel suite.

A very popular hotel on the internet. We were given a room with not so magnificent view, probably we have chosen the city view room instead of sky view room. The room is located at a lower floor too, so all we can see is the water tank on roof top of the building behind us. Small but quite comfortable room.

Great hotel, excellent location and very nice staff. Only downside was our room size which was tight to move around, we knew the rooms were Micro- themed and with this in mind we did email in January asking to be upgraded to the larger upper floor rooms given it was a special occasion we were coming over for ( Our 30th Wedding Anniversary), to which we received a reply saying that this shouldn__ be a problem and would be sorted for our arrival on June 30th. Sadly it wasn__, and despite asking again at reception if we could upgrade we were told we couldn__ as the hotel was fully booked. We didn__ let that spoil our trip though and our impression of the hotel and staff didn__ change, really nice hotel and staff, just a pity about our room.

Cool hotel in Midtown
New cool hotel with a today vibe. They make the most out of small space. Pizza they sell is really good. Rooms are small but it is NYC. Shower was one of the best ever. Can't imagine having more than 2 people in the room and if they don't know each other well in the beginning, after a day they will know one another well.
Pros: Cool Vibe, contemporary. Good people especially Miguel.

Now these are typical small rooms but we were there for one night and the bed was cozy and comfortable. Lastly the staff was friendly, courteous, and helpful. A special thank you to Brianna!!

Amazing views, great staff, and adorable room
I cannot express how impressed I am with this hotel. The staff was great at check in and check out making it a quick process under 5 minutes. We had a room on the 19th floor with the Manhattan view which was truly unbelievable. We had a few drinks on the roof top bar (Please do yourself a favor and try the froz√®) delicious and boozy! The room was clean, practical and perfect for a one night stay. (We were only staying because we can__ ftom CT to see U2 play st Madison Square garden). We also has dinner before the concert at the restaurant in the lobby. Probably the best pizza I have ever had in my life. Honestly this was an amazing experience. I highly highly highly recommend staying at the Arlo NoNad. It__ also in a great location close to the main attractions of NYC!

First time visiting New York, but loved staying at Arlo Nomad. The rooms were small, but realistically you don't spend a lot of time in them when you're in the city anyway. Very clean and comfortable. The thing that made the stay so great as the friendly and welcoming staff. They were helpful with any and all questions. Will definitely look into staying here again when we come back.

I was attending a conference located in upper midtown, and after reading some reviews I ended up booking my room at the Arlo Nomad. I pleasantly discovered the NoMad area has a lot to offer in terms of quaint restaurants and diversity. I had two of the best meals of my life at restaurants within walking distance. The area has more of a community feel and much less commercial than the times square area. The hotel itself has a euro contemporary youthful vibe. Rooms are small but well-equipped with mostly everything you would need including a small fridge and I was pleased to use the clothes steamer that actually works better and faster than a traditional iron and board. The staff were very attentive and friendly

Hip hotel in great location near Empire State
Small rooms but well set out and excellent beds. Rooftop bar spectacular but annoying to be served a drink in a plastic cup. The hotel needs to sort its lift out too, where you can wait almost 10 minutes to get to your room because hotel gives priority to customers going to its rooftop bar over the hotel guests! It__ a small niggle though. Overall we loved the hotel and its location.

Hello Bernadette, Thank you for your feedback. We are glad to know that you enjoyed your stay overall.

We do appreciate your opinion and look forward to seeing you again sometime soon. Thanks, Maggie Houston General Manager"

The staff at this hotel are all amazing, the hotel itself is pretty good. Where the Arlo NoMad falls short is the lack of elevators (2 for staff guests and a very busy roof-top bar which gets priority), I had to wait up to 15 minutes for an elevator in peak times. The rooms are nice but very tiny (not ideal for more than one person). I loved most things about this place, but I will not be staying again due to usually having a tight timeline when in New York. If you don't mind accounting for elevators wait times in your daily travel plans then its a pretty good place (26th floor also takes some time to walk).

The location is great. The hotel is very modern and clean, however, I travel to New York not infrequently and the room is ridiculously small, even for New York standards. You cannot fit 2 medium suitcases in the room at all. Many of the comparable hotels in the area are much more spacious. The reason for my poor review though, is that upon check out, I was told that a taxi or Uber would cost $140-160 to get me to LaGuardia and that I should just pay the guy working at the front desk CASH and he would arrange me a ride. I argued, and he told me it was the toll roads that would bring up the cost of my ride. I took a chance and booked my own Uber which costed $39 included tolls and a tip. It__ one thing to be ripped off by a stranger in New York, but to be ripped off by an employee at a hotel you__e spent thousands of dollars at already makes you leave with a sour taste in your mouth. I will be back in New York in a few months, and will gladly pay more to stay somewhere else.

Hello Matt, Thank you for taking the time to share such detailed feedback.

As a micro hotel, we know our rooms can be a bit cozy compared to non-micro sized rooms. We try to be as transparent as possible, even including our rooms' square footage on all booking platforms, and understand that you may not have been aware of our micro room concept upon your booking. This is definitely information we will look into. We are also disheartened to hear of your concerns with taxi fare. This service is certainly not our standard and we have already addressed this with our team. We would never want you to feel ""ripped off"" by Arlo and take your comment very seriously.

Elevators Are a Problem
The staff at the Arlo Nomad, while very young, is also very helpful and professional, so no worries there. The rooms are VERY small for more than one person, although attractively designed. The real problem was the elevator--if you stay on one of the upper floors, you will be sharing an elevator with a lot of traffic for the rooftop bar, and you can expect a substantial wait to go up or down at virtually any time of the day. The rooftop bar, which I visited out of curiosity, was possibly the loudest space I have ever been in. It would be no exaggeration to say that hearing loss could occur in a matter of an hour or so. Amazingly, none of this sound seemed to be a problem in our room 15 floors below, thank heaven.

Best Hotel I've Been in NY
Did not know what to expect as I had to book something for one night last minute due to some issues booking elsewhere. So glad I booked here because we really enjoyed our stay! The location was perfect for where we needed to be. The amenities are great. It's such a cute and chic hotel, loved everything about it. Staff was amazing, especially the folks at the front desk. They were very helpful and courteous! The rooftop bar with the views of the city and proximity to the Empire State Building were amazing. We stayed in the King Bed Sky Room, which is one of the corner rooms on a higher floor and the views from the room alone are worth it! Sunset and Sunrise were magical. The room itself is a bit small, but nothing that bothered us too much especially for one night. I wish we could have stayed longer but will definitely come back and book again for a future trip!

Pleasantly surprised by this boutique hotel!
This is a real jam in Manhattan a reasonably priced hotel with compact rooms but a lot of charm. There__ a great restaurant in the lobby, and a work area that looks like a study. The crowd is young and fun and the hotel staff lacks the snobbish pretentiousness or comparable hotels. Plus the view of the Empire State from some of the rooms is submime. The neighborhood is considered Nolan__ land in manhattan but it__ not too far from the park and other fun neighborhoods. Overall had a very enjoyable stay.

Fantastic neighborhood, not super touristy but central to everything, useful subway stations nearby. I was a solo traveler and found the room size large enough for me, though I think it would have been tough for two people. Sort of awkwardly laid out, not a real place to put your suitcase. Elevator area is an absolute nightmare, especially at the end of the work day when everyone is going up to the rooftop bar (which is fabulous). Bodega staff and housekeeping were excellent, the front desk staff were basically nonexistent. Practically nothing was communicated to me about the hotel. I'd stay again for the neighborhood, but this is more of a trendy bar spot than a welcoming hotel.

Great location, the public areas are well-designed and friendly. The rooftop view must be seen. It gets crowded at night, but in the daytime we had the place to ourselves. The bodega is handy. All the staff was friendly. The room we had was small and the bunk beds are a little tough to manage as middle-aged visitors, but we did and the beds were comfortable. The price plus location plus the hotel's common areas make this an excellent choice for someone without unlimited funds. Definitely recommend!

Big fast city...small rooms and slow elevators
NYC is a fast paced city known for its style, hip neighborhoods and small accommodations. Arlo Nomad checks all three boxes. Arlo features thoughtfully designed, spartan rooms and a terrific roof deck bar. That written, Arlo__ efficiency and elegance grinds to a halt once you wait 15 minutes to hail one of its three elevators. Arlo__ lift system offers its guests the opportunity to slow down, hang out in a line and shun all momentum the energy of the city may have provided. Thankfully you won__ be living in the elevator during your stay...it just may feel that way.

Posh, great location, and excellent staff. This has been one of my most enjoyable stays in New York. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. My check-in and check-out experience was a breeze. I loved that you have to scan your room key to get on the elevator and once again inside the elevator for security purposes. The shower and bathroom itself was spacious and a lovely modern style. They have full size shampoo, conditioner, and body wash pumps in the shower that are high quality. There's a convenient 24 hour food and drink shop and a great restaurant on site. If you don't care to spend on the restaurant, there's a 24 hour store/restaurant 3 doors down called Bread & Butter that has every type of food, snacks, and beverages you could possibly need! Such a convenient location with great coffee shops and restaurants nearby. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 is the fact that the A/C was mediocre. This seems to be a common issue in all the New York hotels I stay in though. I had it at the lowest setting of 65 degrees and the room was just comfortable enough to not be sweating. I'm the type of person that gets cold easily, so the fact that I had to set it that low tells me it might be a problem for some. Other than that, I had a great stay, and it was nice waking up to a nice view of the city every morning.

Great overall
Excellent location and great customer service! The rooms are small but that is expected for a New York City hotel. I will say that it was amazing how every single inch of the room was used to maximize the space and overall was cozy. The room was spotless! The only thing that was a bit bothersome for me and my husband was the loudness of the A/C. It was turning on and off about every 5 minutes, waking us up several times throughout the night. Also, the elevator situation is a little bothersome...5-10 minutes waiting time to get on the elevator are not unusual.

I remember when hotels used to be real hotels
I may be old style but, not so long ago, booking a 230+$ hotel night meant you had a good size room with a mini-bar, spacious bathroom and enough space to welcome 2 adults. There would also be room service, some hotel/city docs in the room and a useful concierge. Nothing of the aforementioned at Arlo NoMad. ++: modern beautiful design and great location + ultra clean. --: NO SPACE!!! elevators are a pain (even had to walk down the stairs after letting go 3 completely packed elevators), bathroom space is almost inexistent, bit pricy for what it is. If you are like me and enjoy a spacious room, this hotel is not for you. Otherwise, it was a good average experience but definitely not worth the price we paid.

Feels like staying in a nightclub, not a hotel
The check-in staff were very welcoming but unfortunately that is basically all you see and/or hear from them. The hotel feels very much like it basis itself upon it's views from the rooms (which are breath taking) but overall it is very much aimed at your 18-35 age bracket. The rooftop bar turns into a nightclub with after workers and walk-ins packing the foyer and the lifts - which you, as a guest, can easily wait for 10+ minutes to head down to the lobby or return to your room.

We stayed for 5 nights in May. Great location. Rooms were clean, quiet and beds were comfortable. There was a small fridge that was nice. The downside was the size of the room. There was only 5-6 hangers for the cubby to hang our clothes in. There was one drawer that was 2"" deep and another cubby that you had to stand on a chair to reach. The toilet/ shower was essentially in the room with a sliding glass partition. I guess you don't come to New York to stay in your room.

Rooms were very cozy. It would be nice for a day, but I was there for 4 and it was too cozy for my comfort. The pillows were way too soft. There was no coffee makers in the room, and when we went down to the lobby to get food (we were told upon checking it, it was 24/7, the 'food' was not ready or available for another hour). The lobby was not 24/7 for food, unless you were looking for granola bars and waters. The restaurant was mediocre. Food was pretty bland, no salt/pepper available. Waitress only came by to give bill, did not check after food was served to see how things were or if I needed more water (since I had none). The elevator was broken so only had 1 that ran beyond 9th floor so the wait for the elevator was long. Because it was so packed, we had to wait almost 20 minutes for the second pick up. Overall, it was a cute hotel with great staff and it was clean, but I would likely not stay again.

Fun hotel, efficient and in a great location
The Arlo group of hotels are modern, fun and in great locations and Nomad is no exception. The rooms are comfortable, clean and efficient use of space. The front desk service is fantastic and they can make a pretty good cup of Joe to get the day off and running

Nice common spaces, rooms have issues
Common spaces - lobby, 2nd floor lounge - are nice and the restaurant for breakfast is good as well as the in house bodega for little supplies. Staff was very friendly and helpful. But, the rooms are very small and the A/C turns off and on constantly and loudly. My two nights there were anything but restful as a result. And that__ what you care most about, so have to say thumbs down.

Overall, ok. Friendly staff, but a bit noisy.
I stayed at the Arlo NoMad during a weekend trip to NYC. The hotel definitely has a hip, swanky vibe, and the staff is really upbeat and helpful. The rooms are rather small for US standards, but still functional. Noise levels were not ideal as rooms seem to have paper thin walls, and the hotel experienced a lot of foot traffic due to the large amounts of non-hotel guests visiting its rooftop. This also created problems when attempting to use the elevator as the hotel only has two. Nonetheless, overall, it was a good experience. The best part was, without a doubt, the staff's friendliness and responsiveness. The worst, the level of noise which made resting a challenge.

STRANGERS CHECK INTO YOU ROOM
Check-in was wonderful, quick and easy. At 1:30am however, they checked another guest into my room. After the guest left my room, the front desk agent called me twice. first to ask if i ordered a pizza and then again after 2am to tell me I didnt have a reservation, which I clearly did. They were very unapologetic about the whole situation and said it must have been a booking issue and they were sorry for my troubles. I don't know about you, but when a stranger walks in your door and starts to unpack at 1:30am and then the front desk agent calls to basically harass you that you didn't have a reservation at 2am even though you paid nearly $500 for the night, I would think some kind of accommodation could be made for the troubles. A free coffee, a slight discount, anything. They are lucky i didn't call the police. Instead, they looked at me as if I was bothering them when I questioned it the next morning. Very unprofessional. I'll never go back.

Very cool hotel, with a gorgeous roof deck. Fantastic views - especially from the corner room. My colleague mentioned that vertigo may be an issue for some (which is a huge selling point for others!) - lots of glass, great view, great price... the rooms were too tiny to hang out in, but who wants to hang out in a hotel room when there's so much to do outside your door?

Micro-rooms with a great view and location
Arlo__ location and killer window views is the selling point. Staff and service is great. Unfortunately, the elevator is limited and slow. And when happy hour comes, one elevator is dedicated for people going to the roof top bar. I wish I was offered an upgrad and was willing to pay for a king bed since rooms are microsize.

Stunning Room, Disappointing Service
This was our second time here. The first time was amazing. This time we decided to go with the sky room that is practically all windows and has incredible views. We were so excited. While the room was stunning, the service just wasn't like last time. Elevators were so slow, coffee staff were difficult and unattentive, and in general it just felt like staff didn't really care. We did love hanging out in the library and on the rooftop. Our room just couldn't be beat, but we won't stay here again because the service was disappointing.

OK as a bolthole
In fairness I booked this hotel thinking it was the (much more expensive) Nomad hotel on Broadway a few blocks away. So it was always going to suffer by contrast. Whilst this is a fairly cheap hotel located righting the thick of Manhattan, I a still not sure it offers value. The rooms are spartan and tiny. Like where do I put my suitcase tiny. Fine perhaps if you are a solo business traveller but as a couple staying 4 nights it felt pretty soul-destroying, to the extent that we decided to take the hot of the non-refundable booking and move to the real Nomad Hotel the next morning for the remainder of our stay in NY. Twice the price but way more than twice the value. As an aside, when we were leaving c5.30pm on a Thursday, it took us 25 minutes(!) to get from the 28th floor where out room was to the lobby. The two elevators are woefully inadequate for the traffic generated by the nay hotel guests and visitors to the popular rooftop bar. It is a design flaw that will dog this place for the entirety of its existence and frustrate guests on upper floors who just want to get down!

Went to NYC to celebrate my Birthday and choose the Arlo Nomad because the pictures looked very stylish and inviting, and I can say that it differently lived up to my expectations. I was upgraded to a 29th floor corner room with fantastic views of the New York Life Building and a sliver view of my all time favorite building the Chrysler. The glass window walls and nice room lay-outs all made for a memorable experience. The roof top view of the Empire State Building is exceptional and not be missed. The bathroom accessories from Blind Barber have a fresh lemon grass scent that leaves an nice understated scent for the rest of the day. Staff was very welcoming and attentive and genuinely seemed interested in providing the best possible experience during my stay.

Visited for a quick overnight to attend a concert at the Garden. What a find! Lobby is very cute and chic. The room was small but well done with a GREAT view of the Empire State Building and the city. After the show we hit the 2nd floor bar-- great design and vibe we would definitely stop by when in town again. This is a wonderful place for a short trip in to the city for sure!

We were upgraded when there was an issue with the room reserved at no cost. From the minute we entered to when we left there was extremely friendly staff at all levels, and an atmosphere that made us feel welcome. Rooms are compact but all amenities were there and working. Bed was a bit hard for me but duvet and sheets are nice. Rooftop view is amazing! Only downside is cost of food in restaurant (also the only place we felt less welcome). Good location to get to shows, Empire State, Grand Central, Flatiron and other locations. Food is available within walking distance and neighborhood is safe.

An absolute gem in Midtown
We loved our Stay at the Arlo Nomad! Everyone on staff was very friendly and super helpful. They assisted us in dinner recommendations, to tour tickets and made check in/out a breeze. Don't miss the view of the empire state building from the rooftop - its amazing at night! The room was very small but beautifully styled and very efficiently used every inch of space; however if you needed to stretch out the common areas had tables and seating that were perfect for eating take out, playing games, and meeting with friends. They provided steamer, umbrella, hairdryer in the room and in the shower really nice ""blind barber"" products for shampoo/conditioner/body wash. The bed was very comfortable. The Arlo is convienetly located about a block and a half from the Empire State building which was our hub for hop on/off bus tour. It was a $4 uber ride to Time Square and a $3 subway ride to central park. We can't wait to come back and stay here and have already recommended this hotel to friends!

The view was great and the bed was very comfortable! Room was extremely tiny and a bit uncomfortable for two people. We only stayed one night and barely spent any time in the room.

Great find! Perfect stay.
Got in on a Thursday night - had reserved a BUNK room. The front desk offered up a bigger room since at the time I was alone. I kept the bunk room as a buddy was coming in the next day. The room is definitely small. BUT it's perfect for just hanging out in the late evening after a long day in the city. Particularly liked the two TV's at the foot of the bunks. The bathroom -- ALMOST as big as the room. The shower -- a real highlight. rain shower head - glass empaneled - relaxing after being on your feet all day. We also ate at the restaurant one night just because my friend got in late on the train. Though pricey for the main dish portion size - it was very good. You must try the Caesar salad. That was good enough to eat twice. It's a funky hotel with some cool features. Will definitely stay here again when I want to hang out in the NoMad area. Close to lots of things - including Penn Station -- just a few blocks away.
Pros: The location is good -- as well as the fact it's got a 24 hour bodega -- Great staff all-round.

Thanks for an amazing stay!
This hotel is so cool! I've been in a few hotels in this area, and this was by far the best value for money! Here are some highlights: - The location is great, only 5 min walk to 34th st shopping area and MSG, and has lots of nice restaurants and bars close by. - The rooms and hotel amenities are all new, super clean and very nicely designed! (My bed in the King Room was divine!!) As for the room size - like in many Manhattan hotels, the rooms are not too big, however the hotel adopted a Japanese interior design style that makes the most out of the space. For me it was enough ,however it might have been too crowded for 2 people. - The staff is super friendly and helpful, makes you feel right at home!

Amazing room with an amazing view
Very lovely hotel, affordable prices and great location. I was given a free upgrade to a higher floor and had an amazing view. The only thing I'd complain about would be their failure to deliver luggage to the room as they claimed to do. After checking in at slightly after 4pm, I was informed that my luggage would be sent up to the room. I went out straight after that and got back past 9.30pm and I saw my luggage still sitting by the reception. I took them up myself as it was not a big deal. They were apologetic about it after all.
Pros: Everything
Location: there is a 24/7 Asian mixed restaurant round the corner. This came in handy if anyone is hungry

Nice no-frills hotel just south of Midtown
I enjoyed my stay at the Arlo NoMad hotel and I liked the no-frills aspect also. Following my initial concern about finding the hotel (the buildings on the street were under construction and it was hard to read their sign), I was absolutely fine with this hotel. The staff was very nice and their was a small coffee/snacks shop right in the lobby. The room was pristine clean!

Great location and room
My son and I enjoyed our stay at the Arlo NoMad, highlights were the location (very central and close to subway) and the room itself - clean, awesome view of Empire State Building and felt very spacious for the ~150 square feet...probably due to bunk bed (my 6-year-old loved the top bunk and the fact that both beds had their own tv) being tucked away in its own space. The young staff was friendly enough although sometimes felt that some of them were a tad too pre-occupied with maintaining the hipster vibe of the hotel...but I guess that__ what you get with staying at a hotel of this ilk. Overall quite pleased with the stay!

Great spot & staff
Stayed overnight and very pleased with the experience. Interesting space, very smooth check-in and friendly staff. Rooms are small but many places to relax within hotel -- and on roof -- so not an issue. Will be staying again when the weather is nicer and the rooftop bar will be open
Pros: Staff, decor
Cons: Long waits for elevators, seemingly every time

Great accommodation.
Stayed on business and just need the ""facts"" it was perfect. I cannot recommend as due to the snow storm I had to arrive in NYC early. Arlo Nomad had no accommodation, for the additional nights. I found another hotel that could take me for all three nights. Arlo, (even though it was overbooked) would not allow one night of cancellation, so I had to hoof it in the snow to three different hotels due to Arlo's unreasonableness. I talked to every staff member including the manager and although overbooked they refused cancellation and said they are very strict as though they were proud of this in the middle of a snowstorm. I cannot recommend it due to that poor customer service. Otherwise the facility is awesome.
Pros: Decore, staff bed and bathroom annnnd price.
Cons: I had to stay in three different hotels due to the Arlo not allowing me to cancel. They were totally overbooked and would not allow me to cancel.

Hello Katherine, Thank you so much for taking the time to offer your feedback on your recent stay with us. We've noticed that there was a bit of contention with regard to your desire to cancel your reservation with us. The reservation that was held with us was a reservation that could certainly have been cancelled however, it was to come with a cancellation charge. We never want our guests to feel as if they have no choice in any matter with regard to their stay with us. The snow storm did distress several thousand travelers in the NYC area, and we apologize for that unpredictable inconvenience, sincerely. We are also happy to know that you did enjoy the environment and the hotel itself while you were with us. We look forward to being of any assistance should your travels bring you back to the NYC area once more. Wishing you well, Maggie Houston General Manager"

The best stay I have ever had in a hotel
1. Amazing location - close to Empire State building, Macy's, Rockefella centre 2. Amazing design - artsy, funky and lively 3. Staff are amazing - friendly, helpful with directions, provided umbrellas when going out shopping on a rainy day, booked transport back to the airport, allowed us to leave our bags with them after we had checked out so we could continue shopping until we had to leave the hotel :) 4. Rooms are a cool design with quirky lighting 5. Rooms have the best showers ever! - [Lemongrass shampoo, conditioner and body wash along with the power of the shower head made you feel like you were having a spa experience each time we showered] 6. We had a view of the Empire State building from the window 7. It was my partners birthday on the second night of our six night stay and the staff placed two bottles of bubbly in the room with a card which was a lovely touch to our evening] 8. The view from the rooftop bar is breathtaking 9. Fresh towels provided and some toiletries if needed e.g toothpaste etc. 10. Bars throughout the building have an amazing feel and design to add to the cool atmosphere in the hotel 11. Wicked music in the lift and hotel [ LOVED THIS!!! ] - whether taking off on your day to hit the streets and go shopping or coming back from a night out, the music in the lift always added to the buzz and truth be told [I danced nearly every-time I got in to the lift :P] All in all, the best day I have ever had in a hotel :)

Small but perfectly formed
A good room as long as you, like me, are a small person. The room has everything you need - comfortable bed, fridge, safe, wifi, nice ring rain shower big windows with nice views of RT he city etc. BUT it is very small. No room to put a standard size suitcase and the bed takes up most of the room space. Only one rather uncomfortable chair so if there are two of you, can__ really see how it would work. My room was on the 18th floor and I could still hear the noise from the building site across the road and emergency vehicle sirens through the double glazing, which I found surprising. Would be nice to have a small tea/coffee making facility but I don__ suppose there would be room. Staff were very nice and helpful.
Pros: Nice shower, comfortable bed, USB ports
Cons: Triple glazing?? Small espresso machine?

Good hotel but need to improve
I arrived to NYC for 1 important business meeting, the meeting was very early in the morning and I asked a wake up call, because I was after long international flight and I know there is a chance Ill ignore my alarm. I explain how important is to make sure Im awake. The hotel forgot to make the wake up call, I didnt wake up and I was late for the meeting I came for. Second I put the sign privacy please on the door because I left important things out of the safebox, the cleaner enter my room enyway to fix the room. Therefore I can say no privacy. just to clarify nothing was missing everything was in my room when I came back , but I asked privacy. The location is amazing! The room was awesome! The view was perfect! Staff members are superb! hotel rooftop is fabulous! Cool bar/restaurant! Special atmosphere!

Overall great hotel with a couple of flaws
Trendy hotel in a nice part of town. Restaurant on site was great. Hotel was clean and felt new. Staff was nice and attentive. Great all the way around minus the size of the room... it's small, even for NYC standards. Also, it had a sliding door on the bathroom with a large space, so there's almost no privacy if you're staying with someone else.

Check in was smooth, friendly staff! Robes not in room upon entry, however provided immediately. Area is a bit lacking (I lived in Manhattan for 10 years and worked 2 blocks from the Arlo NoMad), the area is centrally located and offers a great launch pad for exploring the city, but is itself lacking in a true identity. It is definitely Korea town, but also in close proximity to the touristy area of Herald square and the corporate vibe of midtown.... The bar staff was friendly but slightly lacking in polish. Rooms small but well designed, the entry level ""bodega"" was a convenient inviting touch. Elevators were efficient. Overall a vibrant vibe, well appointed rooms and eager service. Not five star, but not left wanting for much.

Great for price, fun city views!
Love the bed surrounded by window. I had a high floor and view of some great buildings. The person who checked me in was very generous to make sure I had a good room, my reservation from orbits had two different room types and she gave me the nicer room type for both nights. The bed was comfortable. The heat worked though it was very loud and the room is not at all insulated because of the windows. The blanket was very thin. I did not ask for another one. They did send up a hot water kettle when I asked even though they don__ have room service! There was an extremely loud scary scream that came from a woman in the hall I believe in the middle of the night about 3-4 am. Overall a cute, well considered design and concept within a budget, attending to the most important things to keep one comfortable and celebrate the great location.

Overall Good
We loved the location of the Arlo as I was traveling for business. Overall our stay was good... but there are a few things we did want to call out. We had called in advance requesting a bath tub as I was traveling with my 4 month old son. They said they did not have baths in the hotel but my coworker who chose a queen room as opposed to our king got a bath. The king rooms which are more exspensive are smaller than the queen rooms and harder to Move around in. The closet space is on top of the fridge and if you unpack your clothes you. Over the vents which makes the fridge warm. This wasn't fun when storing breast milk. The front of house staff was amazing however the retaraunt staff could use some work. We did love 2 female servers but are blanking on their names. If traveling solo with out the baby I would stay here again but it's not the most family friendly.

Great for solo travelers
Very small room, but fairly well-designed. I stayed in a City View room where the bed sits on two sides directly in front of large floor-to-ceiling windows, which helps to keep the room from feeling too closed in. Very good shower. Excellent for a solo traveler, or two people who get along very, very well together. Only complaints: 1) The bedside lights were not appropriate for reading at night; you have to turn on the general overhead light, putting the room at full brightness. 2) The desk is a continuation of the sink/vanity counter, without any change in height for the desk portion. It needs a higher desk stool, because you end up sitting too low in comparison to the desk height, making working a bit uncomfortable. Very surprised that the designers missed this ergonomic detail. Otherwise, excellent service, great staff. This was my first stay at Arlo Nomad, and I have already reserved for my next NYC trip later this year.

CUTEST AND CLEANEST HOTEL
SOO CUTE!!! When you walk in, the hotel is so trendy and the staff is extremely welcoming and kind. I got there at 10AM after taking a red eye, and they were able to do early check-in __ Thank God. They also have their own restaurant and a 24/7 bodega... Come on __ Room is so cute and comfortable. The room isn't THAT small - people need to chill.. It's definitely big enough for 1-2 people. Super clean and my room had an awesome view __ It's in the middle of Koreatown/Midtown, so it's extremely walkable and busable to a lot of touristy sight seeing places in Manhattan.. and near hella cute cafes and late night bites! Booook it doo it

Hotel has a really chic style. Like most of the other manhattan hotels I've stayed with, the room was not at all spacious however reasonably arranged. It was a comfort stay in general. The service was great. My room wasn't properly cleaned when I checked in and they gave me an upgrade which I found very satisfying. Location was great and convenient. Located right next to a great Korean restaurant. Close to Herald square. Bonus point for the Bluetooth speaker!

Comfortable and central
The location of the hotel is very convenient. I struggle walking but was able to walk to Times Square , Rockefeller and Empire State. Near shops- Maceys etc and cafes. The staff were very helpful and welcoming , without being effusive. The hotel had a 24 hr cafe, plus a restaurant and a bar. The rooftop is well worth a visit, with amazing views.The bar on the rooftop is seasonal but I should imagine it is a great place to have a relaxing drink after a hectic day. The rooms were small, but only as expected in a city centre location. The shower was large and comfortable and the beds super comfy. Toiletries were provided and smelt lovely. ( Heads up- no toothpaste/ brush as in some hotels) There was no noise in the rooms from outside or other guests. I would highly recommend this hotel

Affordable and cute!
Just in time for New York Fashion Week, I feel like we snagged a really good deal at Arlo Nomad. We got to JFK around 6am and by the time we got to the hotel, it was aobut 7am and the front desk was nice enough to answer my early check-in questions and keep our luggage until check-in time. The decor of the place was incredibly modern and aesthetically pleasing, so we didn't mind waiting after having a quick breakfast in the area. This hotel is right on 5th Ave., a few blocks from the Empire State Building and A LOT of good restaurants. There's even a 24-hour deli/grocery store right around the corner! The room -- amazing views, very modern but not a lot of space. Our room had killer views, but a little too tight for my taste. I guess that's NYC for us! The front desk & staff -- our favorite was David, who took care of our luggage and brought us up to our room. Folks in the front desk had a varying mix of temperament -- specially the ones on Thursday mid-morning (sorry ladies :( ) but they were probably tired of me asking if we can check in already. Overall, we enjoyed our stay here!

Feels like a staying in a Doll House!
So the Arlo Nomad was a cool ""hipster"" hotel. It had a fun vibe down in the lobby and is in a good centrally located part of town... Now the not so good... The bedrooms are insanely tiny... not like a ""cool"" small either. My girlfriend and I could barely fit our suitcases and ourselves into either style of room that we had booked. Now, if the hotel was significantly cheaper this wouldn't be such a big deal, but the hotel is quite pricey and extremely small. Unless you are the size of a twig and love paying a fortune to stay in a shoebox, look elsewhere!!!

Good hotel but basic
The hotel was good but not great. There was a little snafu with our check in which was a little annoying but they handled it well. The rooms are very small but fairly functional, while the downstairs bar/coffee area is good and the roof is great. The location is also good (Her Name Is Han next door is a truly excellent Korean restaurant) There were a few little annoying things about the hotel -- slow elevator service, missing perks in room (limited tv channels, no minibar) -- that made it not feel particularly luxurious. Next time I'd be tempted to try one of the other similar hotels in the area (the Ace, etc), unless the Arlo is notably cheaper.

Not a 4 star hotel
The room is small, which is understandable since it is NYC. However, the room is not as clean. The towels are old and hard. Sheets are not good quality. There is no concierge services?! No complementary coffee?! Front desk kids are nice but seemed very inexperienced and not warm and courtesy enough. Just a bunch of pretty looking kids. They do not know the subways system, restaurants nearby. This hotel is for young kids who do not just want to hang out and have a drink. Terrible.
Pros: Feels like a hostel.
Cons: Needs some class. It is a 4-star hotel. Or lower the star rating to 2 or 3
Location: not much to say.

Does not worth the price
I was very excited to stay in this hotel, but I turned out to be very disappointed to the room and most importantly the services. I have booked for the Queen Bed (Sky.) room because of the attractive pictures online. 1) The room was so much smaller than expected. There weren't any slippers, front desk has indicated to call them later to confirm, which we have done. They soon said they will bring two pairs in, then immediately called again and said they don't have any. 2) Do not feel welcomed overall. We asked if there are any higher floor's room available, the girl did not even check and just turned us down. Compared to other hotels with the same price, their services does not meet my expectation at all. With this price, I could have gone for other nicer hotels such as Hyatt. But I have chosen this hotel because of the two huge floor to ceiling window next to the bed.
Pros: The location is great.
Cons: Services for sure

Overall a great trip, except in the morning when I took a shower, the shower head was not working, and I didn't have time to wait for them to fix it. The front desk was very apologetic about it, but making sure the shower works should be a priority for housekeeping / maintenance.

Great midtown location
I'm a big fan of this hotel. This was my second time staying there. I find it very comfortable and well-located. I love the smell in the lobby! This time I did not have a good experience at the restaurant. I was kept waiting repeatedly throughout my meal. The dining area was far from full and my server was inattentive and distracted. But overall, I really like Arlo Nomad and will stay there again.

Nice Hotel
Clean and new hotel, room was small but comfortable. Staff is friendly, a little slow to get coffee from the shop inside. No water offered in the room, which is annoying in the middle of the night when needing it. Location is easy for subway transport. Would stay again, but would need some water provided in the room which is a small needed detail.

Cons: offering water in the room

Arlo Staycation, Year 2
One block from K-town and a bunch of subways, which made it super convenient to get pretty much everywhere. Beautiful room with floor to ceiling windows and a partial view of the Empire State Building. The only thing lacking (and we didn__ even realize it until we brought our lunch) - no desk in room so we ate on the floor and on the bed. Stayed at Arlo SoHo for last year__ birthday staycation but appreciated the convenience of this NoMad location this year. Both hotels are fabulous and welcoming and have great public spaces to work or lounge in. Arlo is becoming one of our favorites!

a great hotel in different aspects
The location of this hotel is great as it's located midtown so it's practically equal distance or very accessible to anywhere you go on the island. It's close to a few subway stations. Its located in Koreatown so lots of good food there. Also close to a grocery store. We had a good view of the empire state building and there wasn't much noise that we noticed while staying at the hotel. The staff was welcoming, check in and out was very smooth and fast. The lobby was hip and mellow so I enjoyed the feel of it. I like how they have mini sessions/events that occurs daily either in the lobby or restaurant/bar. The room was spacious enough for two people. We had the bulk bed room and it still had quite some space. The only thing about the room was that we saw some wood chipping or breaking from the nails screwed in so it didn't look appealing. I liked how the room had the essentials that we needed for the trip for example, hair dryer, towels,shampoo, conditioner, body wash, cups, a safety box, a mini fridge, hangers, umbrella and soap bar. I enjoyed that the staff pays attention and actually cares for their customers staying at the hotel. We have maintenance people coming in and out of our room because the power box was located in our room. With all the interference, the hotel was kind enough to give us a free breakfast for any troubles/interference we had gotten.

A little peace in a big city.
This Hotel is modern with a touch of class. It is minimalistic but in such a way that it is peaceful and homely. This is just what you need when you are experiencing the hustle and bustle of the streets of New York. Nothing was too much for the front of house, we were always greeted with a smile. The room was the city view and it had everything you needed for a city break with an amazing view. I was on the 22nd floor so there was minimal noise which was perfect. This hotel is within walking distance to Times Square and other main attractions without them being too close and touristy. I would recommend this hotel to couples, friends and lone travellers.

Boutique hotel,cozy,trendy,small room,good service
Overall the experience has been great! Room a bit small but Carly's service at the front desk has been impecable, assertive, helpful and genuine. I would go back because of her. Reason for what i gave 5 out 5 points. A bit of more consistency across the PM shift agents would be ideal but Kelly AFDM is good too. Room is very clean, small if you have a big piece of luggage but thoughtfully designed. Love their ""studio"" meeting room/ library if you need to work is amazing, fast Wi-Fi. The coffee shop serves food and drinks across front desk is good but service to be improved. I wouldn't mind to go back

Awesome! NYC at Christmas
Great hotel, great location. Clean, modern, and a delightful staff. Rooms are small (it's New York) but they make the most of them. Very clean and comfortable. Bed was great. The lobby bodega has great coffee and snacks in the morning. The second floor lounge was great for a drink and a snack in the evening. Didn't try the restaurant but everyone said it was good. Make sure you go to the roof top outdoor lounge and check out the view, looks like you could reach out and touch Empire State building.
Pros: Staff could not have been any nicer. Great location, clean and modern.
Cons: NA
Location: Excellent location. Quick walk to Empire State Building, Macy's, Herald Square and Penn Station. Subway stations are a quick walk also. Safe area.

Good location but LOUD
If you are looking for a quiet cozy place try somewhere else. The common lounge space was reserved for private parties much of the time. The music played in all the common areas was very loud all day and night making it difficult to have a conversation or relax quietly. The room was expectedly small so it was disappointing not have a larger space to spend time quietly.

We all know the room is small, however the ventilation of the heating is extremely noisy and we could hardly go to sleep, the worst is, we tried to ask front desk to exchange a room, and I did think the they are fully aware of this problem and the woman tried to shift and stall our attention by saying they would send an engineer to check on the system, however, nothing happened at all, no feed back at all.

Tiny room, large price. Not a good value at all.
The hotel is conveniently located to Penn Station, Madison Square Garden and many subway lines. The staff was extremely friendly and professional. However, the room was TINY and not at all a good value for the price that I paid for the room. I've stayed in NYC hotels many times and expect a small room when staying there but I've never experienced a room as small as this one. If I'm going to get a shoebox room then I expect to pay a shoebox price which certainly was not the case for this stay.

Horrible smell all over. I complained about someone smoking in one of the rooms and they did not care. The entire floor smelled like smoke. The rooms are beyond small. It was either me or my Carry-on in the room. The phone did not work even though I made 8 complaints and kept being told they would fix it. I had to pay long distance fees on my cell phone. Elevator is very noisy woke me up all hours of the night. No wifi connection. Had to connect to the Avalon hotel next door. Carpet was stained and chair defiantly had mail body fluid stains. view was a brick wall and other hotel rooms.

Trendy, Modern and Clean Hotel - Great Location
Nice, clean and modern hotel in a great location. Just around the corner from the Empire State Building. Rooms are small but we'll thought out. One word of warning is that the bathrooms are integrated in to the room with only a frosted glass sliding door to seperate you from the room so privacy in the bathroom is limited if there are 2 of you staying and the lifts can be very slow. Drinks are quite pricey in the bar and food menu was innovative but slightly limited. Overall a great stay, great location, great views and clean and modern. Really enjoyed our stay :-)

Great hotel - but rooms could be bigger
Nice hotel - and great location for black Friday being right on 5th avenue (and a couple of blocks from Macy's and Madison Square Gardens). The rooms are very clean but TINY - you have to skirt around the end of the bed and dodge the TV to get to the other side (and with big suitcases it can feel like you're living in a cupboard). The shower was good - great water pressure. But the toilet is only separated by a sliding frosted glass door, which has huge gaps....I suggest asking your partner to leave the room if you want to keep the romance! All in all though I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. It is right next door to a fantastic deli as well where we ate a hot buffet breakfast every day.

Great hotel in Midtown
Loved our stay at the Arlo No Mad. We had a queen sky room and a view of the Empire State. The views really sell it especially after a long flight and taxi ride! As other people have said the rooms are small but we stayed as a couple for 5 nights and the room size was fine for us. Have to mention the house keeping as they were in changing things every day and it was always spotless. We didn't eat in the restaurants so can't comment. Wouldn't hesitate in recommending this hotel and staying there again!

Arlo Nomad: Clean and Efficient
I wanted to check out this hotel as I have had several coworkers stay here and tell me it was great. I'm from NYC but recently moved away and return frequently for work. I like to check out different hotels each time I travel. Unfortunately, I was too busy to take full advantage of the restaurant or rooftop but the rest was great. Pros: Lobby bodega with water/drinks, food, and snacks Clean and efficient rooms Nice looking lobby and restaurant I'm sure the rooftop bar was nice Hot powerful shower Big windows Loud ac fan Location Decor Not pro or con: Rooms are small, but you should know that already. Many NYC rooms are and this was fine for me since I was hardly in the room. Desk chair was more like a stool and wasn't terribly comfortable working on for a few hours. Minor detail I know.

Great location with all the necessary comforts.
The view from the 29th floor is forever imbedded in my mind. A cleverly appointed room in contemporary style requiring minimal space without feeling claustrophobic. Very secure access to rooms and great staff. Food wise, all your needs and anx are met, and separate common spaces for quiet work and intimate bar scene. Yoga/Pilates offerings were a real treat.

Overall for the stay, it is pretty good. Location is good, service is good, hotel is dedicate. Which means that the room space will a little bit tiny, especially for the king sky view room. However, for the Queen City view room, it seems to be larger than the king sky view room.

Modern/trendy hotel
Hotel is super trendy and modern. Rooftop has breathtaking views of the city and is open year round. Rooftop bar is only open during certain seasons. Rooms are tiny, but most NYC hotel rooms are... the floor to ceiling window rooms (sky view) are really nice and offer a unique hotel experience. I would recommend booking the sky view rooms and getting the highest floor possible. Overall, a very hip hotel in a great location. Most definitely recommend staying here for the full NYC experience. PS- The Pizza downstairs is ridiculously good!

Floor to ceiling windows with an amazing view
My boyfriend and I decided to stay at the Arlo Nomad for our anniversary and it did not disappoint. We chose to stay in the queen sky room solely for the views. I requested that our room be as high up as they had available and the staff willingly accommodated us with no problem (28th floor). The room is small but we already expected that. When we walked into our room we immediately were WOWed. Room was clean, bed was comfy, pillows were a little flat but that was my boyfriend__ ONLY complaint. We are already talking about visiting again.

Very cozy and clean hotel close to subway.
It was as I had expected. Nice and cozy. Don't expect a nice view unless you are getting a sky view. I only needed the room to sleep so it did not bother me. Staff are nice, although service is not outstanding. I would return to this hotel for it's convenience. Location is great.
Pros: Location and clean and cozy rooms.
Cons: The noise from the heating system. It is so loud that it woke me up more than several times at night.
Location: You can walk everywhere. Empire State building and Korea Town just around the corner. Time Square just 10-15 minutes. AMAZING LOCATION!

Nice but not for us.
Pros: Very clean, nice staff, and 24 hour bodega in the lobby! Stylish art and fun details throughout. Good location, close to the Empire State Building and Flatiron district. Excellent views from room. Cons: Room was VERY, VERY SMALL. My husband bumped into the TV when he tried to walk around the bed, and he is not a large person. Also, NO PRIVACY - the door to the bathroom is a glass door that doesn't go all the way up the ceiling. You can definitely hear and nearly SEE everything that it s going on in there. Fine if you're staying alone, but there are certain things you just don't want to DO in front of anyone else. This was a major con for us, and the reason we won't be staying again.

Decent hotel on limited space
Really enjoyed the playlists of music in the bar, lounge and restaurant, the staff were terrific and a cut above the class of many of the Arlos nearby rivals. The rooms are simple white yet offer everything you need and the views complete the picture. It feels comfortable for a mid town NYC hotel. The rooftop bar is special and I hope it continues to bring in lots of custom. The $50 charge per hour of excess use after 7pm on the Arlo Bicycles is absolute nonsense - the bikes should be fitted with lights and evening cycling should be permitted. At peak hours the lifts can leave guests waiting a painfully long time. Service at breakfast on two occasions was torturous for lack of sufficient staffing or knowledge of the menu.

Terrific, but don't bother putting in requests.
Arlo Nomad is a great hotel! I loved the atmosphere and vibe. It was very clean and up to date. However, like all NYC hotels the rooms are tiny. My only complaint would be that the notes that I left on my reservation to get a corner room were not read/or taken into consideration which is a huge bummer considering one of the main appeals of this hotel was the huge windows in the rooms. However, I really enjoyed my stay overall.

It was a cool hotel, different than your usual hotels. Would__e liked the bathroom to have soap for when we arrived. It is quite tiny in the rooms but overall cool concept. Staff we friendly but didn__ go above or beyond.

Amazing micro hotel in a great location
My husband and I recently stayed at the Arlo NoMad for our anniversary, and it was an amazing stay! The staff was great__hey even left us a bottle of wine to congratulate us, which was a great surprise upon check-in. The room was much bigger than I expected after reading several reviews, and it was really clean. The use of space was interesting, too. There are lots of nooks and crannies to store stuff, making the best of the small space. The bed was insanely comfortable (I really need to find out what brand of pillows they use so I can buy some for myself), the bathroom was clean and in good condition, and I was impressed with housekeeping's ability to clean our room every day, no matter what time we left the room. The location was also really great. It's in such a walkable location that we didn't use the subway the entire time we were there. There is some street noise, but if you request or reserve a room on a higher floor you shouldn't be able to hear much at all. It is NYC, after all, but we were on the 16th floor and were never bothered by outside noises. The rooftop bar is really cool and has obviously spectacular views. It was a bit of a bummer to be served a $20 drink in a half-full plastic Solo-type cup, but I understand why giving drunk people glass on a roof is a bad idea. Haha! The bar on the 2nd floor looked really cozy, but there are only a few seats and it was full each night we tried to visit. Regardless, I definitely recommend this hotel!

Quaint, Cool, but Rough around the Edges
Nice, modern hotel. On a super smelly street, lots of garbage. Nice, young staff and great lounge areas. Great elevators, very clean. Room was in poor condition. No wall clocks (had been pulled off the wall), hooks weren't secured tight to the wall, a bit worse for wear. Happy with the steamer and shower products. Wouldn't go back, there's better out there for the price. Bed was pressed up against part of the wall and I kept rolling into it. or hitting with my arm. Super awkward small layout.

Worth it for the atmosphere and views
This hotel is SO cool. The second floor has lounge and bar areas and work spaces and was useful when we needed to hang out for a little while after we checked out but before we needed to leave NYC. The rooftop is worth it- amazing views and fun atmosphere and the glass floor was so cool. Our hotel room was on the 10th floor- decent view- the floor to ceiling window gave it an extra flair. My only complaint is the sheets were slightly scratchy and the cotton was balling up- they were clean but not the most comfortable. The room was small- about 18 inches of room around the edges of the bed to walk by- but we were only there for one night and didn't have a lot of luggage to fit so this wasn't an issue for us.

Lively, funky hotel in midtown.
A very modern hotel, in a great location, wonderful view from the roof top bar and a large comfortable meeting/ work room. Breakfast/ coffee bar and great restaurant on site also. The rooms are comfortable and the bed was too but my room was very small. Two people would trip over themselves. Ask for a quiet room- my room had noise from outside like an air conditioner that went on all night. Otherwise a cute place to come home to.

Arlo Nomad
I stayed here for a recent work trip. The hotel was nice and modern, but my only issue is the elevator situation. I know all elevators are small, but a ton of people come to hang out at their roof top bar, which then backs up. One evening when I got back to the hotel I had to wait for a 3rd elevator before being able to get back to my room. The hotel should think of having a dedicated elevator to the roof, since it becomes very inconvenient for guests. I can't say I'll stay here again because of that.

Sky-View Room only
The location is perfect, which is located at the mid-town of Manhattan. I originally want to book the sky-view room, which comes with the giant french window and brilliant city view. However, the photos of room that expedia site provided does not show any difference about the sky-view room and city-view room so I choose the city-view room by its name. There is only one side of window in city-view room and there is no vent in the bathroom. And the room is quite small.

Solid Value, Hip Venue
Very comfortable hotel. Reminded me of a 'light' version of the Ace hotel with a great lobby, space to work, hip bar, great rooftop bar, etc. The room was small, but really efficient. The one thing that stood out to me was the shoddy tile work in the bathroom. It looked like there was grout smeared everywhere, lumped in places, etc. The bathroom was clean, but the grout everywhere made it fee a little tacky/dirty.

STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!
This was our first trip to NYC and we could have not chosen a better hotel to stay!! We considered paying much more money to stay in a 5 star, but I am so glad we didn't. This hotel was perfect for our 6 day stay. Upon check-in the staff immediately upgraded our room (without us having to ask) to a wonderful room with a view of the Empire State Building. Check-in was smooth and we were quickly on the rooftop patio/bar to see breathtaking views of the city. The view was so spectacular that we didn't even feel the need to spend the money to go to the top of 30 Rock (which had been our plan). The hotel was in the perfect spot to get to all of the neighborhoods. We walked everywhere: Times Square, Broadway, Central Park, 5th Ave., Chelsea Market, and more! If you don't feel like walking, they even have free bikes to check-out. At the end of our stay they gave us a complimentary late check out because we had a late flight. The staff was always super friendly and helpful. The roof-top bar is the best. The rooms are clean and modern with stunning views. The hotel provides entertainment and fitness classes. It really is the perfect place to stay. We will definitely be going back!

Close to Penn
I recently stayed here for an event at MSG and it was a perfect stay. It was a couple blocks away from Penn station so the location was perfect for us. The hotel itself was beatlutiful, they had a restaurant located behind the lobby and a 24hr bodega located inside the actual lobby. Check in was fast and the individual that helped check us in was friendly and gave us information about what we can do inside the the hotel. A bar on the second floor and a roof top bar. I wish my stay was longer so I could have enjoyed these amenities. We had a room on the 29th floor which is the highest floor besides the bar (beautiful view) The room was small but the design made up for its size. Very clean and taken care of. The elevator system was cool and made me feel safe that random people couldn__ come to your floor without a key. over all great stay and would love to stay here again to expeirence what I missed my last stay.

The Arlof Hotel !
My wife and I booked a room for the night and we were quite pleased ! Upon walking into the hotel, there was a pleasant aroma coming from what seemed like scented cinnamon candles. Very nice lighting in the check-in area. Staff was friendly, professional and attentive. The room we booked was small but I have to say, quite comfortable and had all the amenities we needed. AC was the right temperature and the room smelled nice and fresh. The bed was perfect but if I'm going to nick pick, at least for me the pillows weren't that good - a bit deflated in my opinion.

good hotel. small room but to be expected downtown new york. nice roof top. everything was great, but i was told the patio was open till 1 or 2 am (I forget exact time at this point). I get up buy a drink and was sent down about 15 minutes later even though it was an hour and a half prior to closing (as I was told by their reception staff). Second night I try to go up with friends after confirming it was open with the lobby staff and again told it is open. We head up and again its being reserved for some event. Overall not a huge deal since theres so much to see in New York. The room is kept clean, has what you expect. Pictures make it look a little bigger than it actually is.

My new go-to hotel for Mad Ave business travel!
I had a couple of minor issues on my first stay here -- the first room I was given had not been cleaned, so they quickly assigned me another room and provided me a comp breakfast. But then a $9.50 charge for the breakfast appeared on my credit card, so free was not so free. Despite those issues, I loved my stay at this hotel! I travel frequently to Madison Avenue for business, and I have tried a number of hotels. I will check Arlo NoMad first from now on. Why? The atmosphere is just perfect. It doesn't feel like a hotel. It feels quirky, creative and comfortable. The rooms, while of course New York tiny, are really well designed to make the most of the space. The beds are super-comfy and the showers are fantastic. There are multiple common areas, including a work area. Plenty of places to cozy up with a book or chat with other guests. A 24-hour lobby bodega. And on my next stay I definitely want to make the most of the roof deck!! There are also absolutely adorable bikes to rent, with baskets. Like most hotels in this area, there is no good space out in front of the hotel for smokers, which I know serves me right because I shouldn't smoke. I went downstairs at about 3 AM for a cigarette, and I was standing next to stinky trash bags stacked as high as my head. But this is not so different from the situation at other hotels. And, I was able to get a soda and a bag of chips from the bodega even at 3 to take back to my room, so that offsets the stinkiness.

Staying in Midtown New York at Arlo Nomad
We chose this hotel due to its central location on 31st street It had a lovely boutique feeling about it with its reception rooms and roof top bar. It's a stone throw from the Empire State Building too Lovely rooms, compact with everything you would need for a good nights sleep - never expected huge room but you cannot get this from many hotels in NYC without paying and arm or leg. It even had its own fridge Bit noisy due to roof generators - so bring ear plugs Roof top bar on 31st Floor gave us wonderful views of the skyline and even had a glass floor in one part We loved the reception rooms and how they were furnished It was a lovely vibe and staff were pleasant and friendly
Pros: It's location on 31st Street and it's boutique feel compared to a massive chain hotel
Cons: Kettle in the room, we had to ask for one and maybe more cloths hangers
Location: 31st Street - near Empire State and Madison Square Garden. Easy access to Time Square

US OPEN WEEKEND
Inside the hotel the experience was awesome, smell and feel as a very good ambient for relax and have fun with all the amenietes that they offer, my only issue was the dirty and bad smell just one step outside the main entrance.
Pros: The new hotel concept related to experiences, and ambient.
Cons: cleanness outside the hotel, the sidewalk smells horrible.
Location: very well located for shopping and dinner.

Not what I was expecting but it grew on me
Situated around the corner from the Empire State Building but not quite what I was expecting. At 150 SQ FT the room could best be described as compact which was a bit of a shock but witt a little organization it worked. However the rooms killer feature was the ceiling to floor windows on 2 sides with incredible views, and with a little luck it could just as easily be of the ESB or like mine the New York Life Building either way the views are very good. The best feature is the roof top terrace/bar which all guests have access to all day which I didn't learn about until my last day as I would have visited every morning just to see the views.
Pros: The staff were very helpful. The room was immaculate if compact and housekeeping was brilliant. It's best feature is location and the views.
Cons: They need to sort out the lifts. It can get a little challenging and time consuming when staff are also using them to get between floors.

Terrible experience
I choose sky view room but they just changed my room since to other option and the space is too small. I was going to check out after 12 and their staffs keep knocking the door which is very annoying and rude. Not recommended and it's not good as expected.

Cute Boutique Hotel in Great Location!
This cute little hotel is located in a great area. The rooms, while small (typical for NYC), are stylish, clean, and comfortable. They have a popular rooftop bar that nearly everyone I talked to in the city knew about. And they do cute hotel activities like morning rooftop pilates. Would 100% stay again.

Amazing Views & Staff
We were staying for our anniversary so I called ahead and mentioned this hoping for a nice room. We showed up to a corner room on the 27th floor with a bottle of wine and card from the hotel. We had just arrived from a red-eye so we were very early and hadn't anticipated our room being ready for a few hours but we didn't have to wait at all. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and the hotel it's self has a lot of charm including a bodega, a bar on the 2nd floor, a breathe taking rooftop bar, a restaurant and a nice library/study room. It's centrally located. The only downside was the size of the room which was very small but the views were worth it. I'd definitely stay here again which is saying a lot since there are so many hotels to explore and choose from. They really are that good.
Pros: Views, staff, style, location, rooftop bar

Disappointing stay in NYC!!
DO NOT FALL for instagram HYPE they all set up for this Hotel!!!! I know while others got luckily their expected SKY VIEW Room, others don't! I am extremely disappointed with my stay at Arlo Nomad, it's my first time in NYC and stayed for 2 nights with my husband and my son. Earlier this year when we decided we are going to New York for 3 days I googled for the best place to experience the city, I had so many good choices and fell to the wrong one, all because I am a sheep (trying to follow the trend) but unfortunately didn't turn well for me. I had booked a stay with Arlo Nomad earlier February 2017 for our stay in July 2017, I've read that in order to get the rooms that you want the tip is to send them an email/call to request for it, which I did. Keeping in mind that I had sent a request they have addressed it, so fast forward to July, a day before our arrival date I've called to confirm and staff told me ""yes we have noted that you requested a room in the higher floor 29th floor"". Day of arrival, I do not understand why it took them so long (almost an hour waiting in their lobby) to give us our room. Right after giving me room on the 24th floor with a very unpleasant view far from what I imagined, corner room that is sadder than life. very small ( I was informed about this). I am so disgusted, I even can't sleep the whole night because the bed is very uncomfortable, I felt very itchy (I was thinking it wasn't changed). I complained about the room I got and was moved to 29

Hello Angela, We're very sorry to hear that your stay did not meet your expectations. While we do our best to accommodate all of ours guests requests, we are very cautious to never promise exact floor numbers due to the challenge in meeting all guests specific requests. While we did have your request for the 29th Floor noted, all Sky Rooms on this floor were occupied on your arrival date. (Our property has only 2 Sky Kings and 2 Sky Queens per floor.) While your 24th Floor room didn't seem to be quite the right fit for you on your first night, we hope that your 29th Floor room was a better fit for you during the remainder of your visit.

Nice hotel in good location
Good hotel close to many attractions - right around the corner from the Empire State Building and within a couple of blocks of the nearest subway. A good walk to Times Square and to shopping (window shopping in our case) on 5th Ave. Check-in and Check-out were great. We flew in early and we're able to leave bags at the desk. We received a phone call telling us our room was ready and we're surprised and pleased that our bags were already in the room. At check- out, we were able to again leave our bags while we toured the city before our return flight. There is a decent coffee shop in the lobby, and for those looking, a wine store a block over. Lots of restaurants nearby. We felt completely safe, whether first thing in the morning or returning later in the evening. The rooms are quite small. The bed in our room was pushed right up against the floor to ceiling windows and only accessible from one side. There was very little storage for bags, and only room for one chair. That being said, the bed was comfortable and considering we were only in the room to change or to sleep, it wasn't an issue. If you don't do well with heights, try to get a lower floor. We were on the 22nd and the ""openness"" was a little unnerving at first. The only ""con"" I can think of is the elevator. Long wait times. The rooftop patio is a must see, day or night. Drinks are pricey and it's quite busy at night, but what a great view of the city!

Informal and chic - great base for a few days.
We stayed as a family for a short break. The bunk room was great for two teens, and cheaper than the usual double room with two double beds. Hotel is smart, informal, chic and well designed. Rooms are very small but well designed and sufficient for a few days. The roof top bar is a wow although we couldn't use it after 2pm because we had minors with us. Restaurant and bars are buzzy and styslish. The bodega works well. A great base for seeing the city.
Pros: Chic and stylish. Great location. Friendly and informal. Good value.
Cons: Elevators are very slow. System for breakfast (vouchers) is clumsy and was not explained to us when we checked in.
Location: Really good central location for seeing the city. Very close to the Empire State Building and 5th Avenue. Easy to get both uptown and downtown.

Best Hotel Ever
This was by far the best hotel I've stayed in during my trips to Manhattan. I travel there 5-6 times a year for work/vacaction/fun and this is my new go-to hotel. From the moment the doorman opened the entrance for me I felt at home, welcomed, and included in the uniquely fun atmosphere. My girl Jeanell was friendly and upbeat and set the positive tone for my whole stay. She recommended places to eat and activities that fit my personality perfectly. Across from the elevators other guests posted cards with activities they found around NYC and fun suggestions about the area. My room and the rooftop bar had incredible views of the city. Every staff member I encountered asked about my day or my stay so far. The bartenders were engaging and lovable and the drinks were unique! The hotel room was the most ergonomically designed room I've ever seen, from sliding doors to luggage cabinets to sink shelving and closet space. Outlets everywhere and USB charging ports perfectly placed to do remote work while taking in the spectacular room view. Rooftop Yoga was an inspiring and uplifting class, despite the sprinkling rain. The food in the restaurants and Bodega were accordingly and competitively priced. Perfect walking distance to nearly everything fun or a subway stop accessing the rest of the city. Can't wait to stay here again and again! Thanks for making it a perfect work/fun adventure!

This was a nice, hip place to stay and the location was great. The staff was attentive and friendly. The room was tiny but we weren't there much and the views were awesome so the size didn't really matter. The negatives were the extremely slow elevators with only 2/3 for guests and priority was given to non guests going to the rooftop bar. Another negative was being served wine in a Dixie cup from the rooftop bar. Not classy. Lastly- this is a ""non smoking"" hotel but people were smoking in the rooms and the smell was overwhelming at times.

City Sky rate only got 13th flr. Kid UN-friendly.
Reception front desk people were not quite on it and could not provide information on how to celebrate the 4th of July at their hotel. Also I went for the higher rate to book a City Sky room on an upper floor for very special guests from California, and got the 13th floor out of 31 floors. Punchline is we paid for 12 nights at this hotel and could not see any firecrackers from the 13th floow. My guests were forbidden from using the Rooftop because we had a guest under 21 and the entire Rooftop is off limits to underage guests because of how alcohol is served. I hope they consider that community should accomodate teenagers and also non-drinkers. Now, if the Front Desk had been ON IT, in a New York City way, they would have told me that the Rooftop is for drinking and off limits to underage guests, and then they should have provided a real City Sky high floor room above the 13th floor to acknowledge the disappointment of my party of guests in being barred from the Rooftop not just on the 4th but every night. I doubt they would have thought of this workaround but I sure would have if they were ON IT during the two very clear conversations I had with them to ask for their help to celebrate the 4th!

Sky room NOT as advertised. NOT SKYLINE VEIW
ROOM: I booked the sky room thinking I would receive a ""skyline"" view as advertised on the hotels website and in the name of the room itself (sky). I was completely disappointed upon arrival to find that my view is of another building on both sides of the corner room (refer to pictures). When I brought this up with the staff they told me all of their sky rooms were fully booked and they couldn't move me to another room. The manager also made sure to tell me ""our sky rooms start on the 11th floor"" and that the ""skyline view is based on availability and its first come first serve"" and I found this very RUDE and as if my concerns were irrelevant and unwarranted. Needless to say this made me very upset as I had something completely different in mind based on the pictures on their website and the description of the room. Not to mention the rooms are VERY small (the entire room is one bed and a sink) and the only reason I had booked this hotel was for the supposed skyline view. And I'm genuinely confused as to why they would advertise rooms as ""skyline view"" when floor 11 to 25 DO NOT have a SKYLINE VIEW. ELEVATOR: There is a rooftop bar on the 31st floor of the hotel which gets very crowded at nights. There are only 3 elevators and only 2 of these elevators go to floors 16 to 31. If your room is above floor 16, expect to wait close to HALF AN HOUR for the elevator to arrive. WIFI: Very bad. Wont load webpages/instagram/snapchat/etc. I DO NOT RECOMMEND staying at this hotel.

Not family friendly.
Hotel property was nice, clean and very convenient to most things. My 14 year-old son and I shared a bunk room. It was small but had all we needed. Hotel has got a very hipster vibe and I think markets to that age group. The rooftop bar & lounge is open to public and starting at around 5 everyday the elavators get jammed having to deal with the transients that go to the rooftop. As a guest I tried a couple of times to go up but it was too crowded and then had to stand in line to get back down on elavator. Twice we took the stairs just because of the wait for the elavators in lobby. On a side note I asked once before arriving if my son would be allowed to go up to rooftop for July 4th and was told yes. Upon arriving I asked bartender if he was allowed up and was told no problem. On July 4th I was told no sorry he can't be up here, not very nice, hence why I titled my review.

Funky modern hotel.
The Arlo NoMad is a great hotel in midtown. It is conveniently located on 31st - just off 5th Ave so you can walk to most places. We had a funky bunk bed room! & although the room was small it had almost everything you need - a bigger wardrobe & some draws would be good! The rooftop bar was busy & had a great atmosphere (check out the glass floor looking down 31 floors) & the restaurant served lovely food. My only complaint about this hotel is the lifts! It took about 10 minutes to get to your room almost every time. Other than that it was great! Highly recommended!

Really recommend
Lovely little hotel with some of the most lovely staff I have ever come across. The customer service really is exceptional. So why not five stars .. Well, as previous guests have mentioned, the lift situation is crazy. It feels like you spend forever waiting for lifts, and frequently have to actually queue. It's particularly bad when the rooftop bar is busy. As a hotel guest, I begrudge having to queue to get to my room with people simply trying to access the bar. Secondly, for a newly renovated building, the air con in the rooms is really noisy. That said, I would happily return. The rooms are really well thought out. Yes, they are small, but this is clearly stated. I had a standard room, which was great for me. May have been a little tight for two. The location is great. Just away from the hustle and bustle, but central enough to access all the main tourist areas. Finally, you're never far from building work in New York. However, there is a big building sites almost directly opposite. You may be better requested a room at the back if you are a light sleeper.

Great location and fantastic staff!
First off, let me say, the pizza here is one of the best I've ever had! Seriously, don't miss it! Arriving at 1am after a delayed flight, my hopes were not high that the check-in experience would be great, but I was blown away at how great the front desk staff was. They are well trained, kind, and very informative. The rooms are quite small, as are many in NYC, but they are extremely functional. Everything has its place and while the footprint was small, I didn't feel like anything was missing. Overall, fantastic place with great food (Massoni is EXCELLENT) and a great staff. Definitely recommend it.
Pros: The food, the location and the staff were all great.
Location: Empire State Building is a couple of blocks away

This is a perfect option if you are looking for a clean, modern hotel room near Penn Station. I took the train up from DC and I was able to walk to the hotel with my luggage. I had a wonderful meal and a great bottle of rose at Massoni - the lobby restaurant. The roof bar looked fun but it was chilly the night I was there. The coffee bar in the lobby is super convenient, had almond milk and also had fabulous croissants, bagels and other pastries (oh and mini packs of pain relievers for sale as maybe I shouldn't have enjoyed so much rose). The rooms are small but well appointed and you cannot beat the price especially for a new modern room. Definitely recommend Arlo Nomad.

Cool fun hotel in the heart of Midtown
My son and I stayed in the hotel for one night. Very hip vibe from the moment we stepped in and a great location. Friendly and extremely helpful check in staff. We were able to use the complimentary bicycles for the day which was very adventurous and fun. The room was small but still very comfortable. We got the room with bunk beds which were unexpectedly very comfortable and fun as I was traveling with my son. Each bunk had it's own TV. The 31st floor rooftop bar was amazing, incredible views.

First the hotel has just opened about 3 weeks Ago so everything is new :) second the hotel location is perfect on 31 st. between Madison Ave. and 5th Ave. third the stuff are very much friendly and helpful! There are 2 problems that I see them as a minor: 1. Small room about 14 sqft 2. There are only 2 elevators for 31 floors so sometimes it takes 5 minutes to go up or down You should remember that those 2 problems are the in most of all the hotels in New York

Great hotel and location!
They did not give me the room I booked. They made me stay in a bunk bed style room that I disliked. I had no choice to stay in that room until the next night. I asked for a better price but they were not willing to do this for me. This is the only point that bothered me. If I book a room they should give me what I booked. They oversold and to me that is poor customer service.

Loved this place, definitely coming back!
Nothing but good to say about this hotel. Love the style/vibe, best shower I have ever been in, loved the design in the room, and overall architecture of the property. The room was pretty small, but its NY and you dont need the ""extra"" space anyways. The staff was amazing! Carlos was the best, he actually made our stay! When he found out it was my girlfriends birthday he quickly ran upstairs while ""our room was being cleaned"" and set up a full surprise for her!! He wrote out a birthday card with her name on it, wine, cookies, chips, and used about 30 small chocolates to spell out ""I love you"" on the bed. He called in to our room periodically to make sure we had everything we needed and just made us very comfortable the entire time. The rooftop bar was beautiful, and so was the 360 view. It's also in a very lively, nice area. Definitely coming back here next time

A hotel in NYC
It is a boutique hotel. Size is very small and how small - you better bring a hand carry luggage instead of a normal size one. When I got in the room I have to figure out how to open my luggage for unpacking. Bed is comfortable and cleanliness. Subway is far away from the hotel. Easy to walk to 5th Avenue for shopping. Closed to Empire State Building and Korean town. One casual restaurant and a cafe for take out. They do have a roof top bar, quite nice.

Pretty good. Fantastic staff.
The room was spotlessly clean and modern. The shower was amazing. The room was very small but very stylish and for a single business traveller just about perfect. One nice thing was that I didn't hear any noise from neighbouring rooms at all. However, there was a lot of noise from outside during the night due to some construction work. This had nothing to do with the hotel at all, but the staff on the front desk were concerned that it was impacting my stay and did everything within their power to help. They moved me to a quieter room as soon as they could and offered me free breakfast the next day. This set the tone for the service from all of the staff at the hotel, who were incredibly friendly and professional. All of them were a true asset to the hotel. The only thing that could be improved is for hotel rooms to have coffee makers in them. I like to have a coffee in the morning when I wake up without having to leave the room before I shower and get ready and I missed this.

Nice hotel - Good location - Friendly staff
I sent an email prior to my arrival requesting a room with a nice view. The reservations department reply was promptly and been offered a room with a nice view to Empire State Building. Upon my arrival the reception staff made us feel very welcomed. We stayed for 7 days. We didn't had the chance to use the restaurant facilities due to our tidy sight seen schedule but the coffee and pastries smelt and taste lovely, every morning. On our departure the reception staff was very helpful!!!! Overall, i will highly recommend Arlo Nomad for everyone who is interested to visit New York!!!

Business Trip with late night check-in
With a late night check in, I was checked in and went up to my room to discover that they gave me a standard room yet I paid for an upgraded room on the Hotels.com reservation. When I called the front desk, from the room, I was told that they overbooked the ""Sky"" rooms and they could move me tomorrow. I was disappointed that this was not explained at the front desk. They called me about an hour later and said they were able to move me to a ""Sky"" room. I had a package delivered to me at the hotel and the front desk signed for it and delivered it to my room. No charges to my bill for the package. The lounge space on the second floor was a nice area to get work done. They had two conference room table where several guests had their laptops open and working there.

Bait and switch
I booked a room at the Arlo because of the photos of the room which showed a great view of the city. While the room seemed very small, you needed to climb over your partner to get out of the bed, it seemed like a decent trade off for the view and a very romantic weekend. So I don't need to explain too much my disappointment when I showed up and my room faced a brick wall 25 feet away with now view of any-kind in sight. The staff was wonderful with dealing with my disappointment even when they could do very little about it but give me a room with a queen bed instead of the king bed I had reserved with a slightly better view then the brick wall. I have stayed a many NYC hotels with all kind of rooms and must say these are by far the smallest rooms I have ever experienced. Upon some reflection I realized that the chances of getting the room I wanted, and was sold by implication, were very small. There are only about 10 rooms with that view in the whole hotel. So be very careful if you are intending to stay here to experience the great city view from your bed.

A cozy and trendy getaway right next to K-Town
I had a fantastic stay at the Arlo NoMad. I came to New York City during the worst possible time - it was raining nonstop and cold, but the hotel was such a nice refuge. The rooms are ridiculously small, but very efficient, clean and cozy. There is a 24 hour snack bar too, which is perfect when you need water or something to munch on when you come into the hotel at 5 am after a night out. They even have very nice umbrellas that we used to avoid the rain. Also, the location is awesome - right next to K-Town so lots of yummy restaurants and fun bars. I would definitely recommend this place and I will definitely be back!

Great rooms with a view & 24 hour cafe
I stayed in a Sky Room, a corner room with floor to ceiling glass on the 28th floor with 24 hour city views (incl the Empire State Building) from my bed. Amazing. It felt like the world's biggest hotel room. Add to that a 24 hour deli cafe in the lobby and a buzzing Italian restaurant, and it's my kind of hotel!
Pros: The room! Cafe. Restaurant. Location.
Cons: Hmmmm ...

Perfect for a Quick Getaway
The Arlo Nomad was a perfect place for us! It is centrally located and close to the Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden as well as several subway stations. The hotel is new, clean and the staff were very helpful. The rooms are small, but the price reflects that. The rooms have every amenity you need. We left the hotel early every morning to explore and came back to the hotel only to sleep at night and for short breaks to rest our feet. If you're someone who travels just to get away and lounge while enjoying room service, this hotel is not for you.

We had an amazing experience here at the Arlo Nomad. The view from our room was breathtaking! Right next to the Empire State Building. The rooms are small, but they were perfect for us! We had an issue with the AC and that was fixed right away. The complimentary toiletries come in large dispensers and smell fabulous. I wish I hadn't even bothered to pack my own!

Great stay!
I really enjoyed my recent weekend in NYC at this hotel. The hotel was in great condition and spotless. Also do the sky room you won't be upset the view was just superb. I tried the hotel resturant when I was there too and the food was very good and it wasn't terribly overpriced for the quality. Hotel also is in great spot too for subway use such as nearby yellow line and orange line and penn station. Near Hearold sq where there are some great shops and restaurants to choose from. Overall I would definitely stay here again. I will tell you the room was a bit small, but you not in New York to be in the room and for the most part hotel rooms in NYC are on the smaller side so don't be alarmed. I also have a thing for showers and this one had the best shower head!! It was so amazing to wake up to the sunshine every morning poring through the floor to ceiling windows that surrounded the bed. Have a great trip and stay here you won't be upset with your decision!!

There would occasionally be a single bar, but it would disappear. Used WiFi from hotel on other side of the block as it had stronger signal (though still weak).

Amazing new hotel right in the center of NYC.
Wow! We were so impressed with the Arlo Nomad. The staff were beyond helpful and friendly. My son and I loved our room with the bunk beds and a stunning view of the Empire State building. Make sure you get to the rooftop lounge, because the views from up there are just breathtaking. One of my favorite spots to hang out was in the 2nd floor library. Our only regret was that we didn't get to spend more time at the hotel. They gave us passes to the local New York Sports Club for our workouts and it was only a few streets from the hotel.
Pros: Brand new, clean and cool hipster vibe.
Cons: I really can't think of anything. Everyone from the front desk to housekeeping were amazingly friendly and helpful.
Location: Great location. Just a 10 minute walk from Penn Station or subway and it is right in between uptown & downtown.

Lovely Stay for 2
I surprised my boyfriend here for our Valentine's Day, and we both couldn't be more happy with our stay. Upon checking in, the front desk was very warm and welcoming. A big plus was that he extended our check out time to 2PM! Free wifi without a login is always a treat. We had a Queen Bed (Sky Room) on the 20th floor. Amazing window space and views of the Empire State Building. Room is chic and modern, providing excellent comfort for the 2 of us. The hotel has a quiet study area on the 2nd floor, bars on the 1st and 2nd floor, a restaurant called Massoni on the 1st floor, and a rooftop lounge that was closed for the winter. Excited to possibly come back during the warmer weather to check it out. There's also a 24-hour bodega with a variety of drinks and snacks to purchase. I can't explain how impeccable the service was from all levels of workers there. Definitely recommend a stay here to anyone!

This hotel is close to a subway station which was very convenient. It is an older hotel and the room I had was rather dark and gloomy feeling. The bed was quite comfortable though. I made a few local phone calls that I was charged for which I think is ridiculous as they were local and not long distance (one of them was even a toll free number).

No if you have asthma or sensitive to fragrance
Modern small rooms but it is NYC. Employees are fantastic. Great location, for food and work. A problem is they infuse the hotel with Fragrance ( which they say is the trend), it is horrible for someone who is chemically sensitive, so I can't stay there again. They made sure my room didn't have scent. Too bad I love the hotel and people. Please remove the fragrance as no one wants to smell that much of something you don't choose .

Great little hotel in Manhattan
I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights while in the city for a tradeshow. Excellent location with numerous restaurants close by. I never tried the Italian restaurant downstairs but they had a very long wait line which leads me to believe it's a good one. Quiet, clean, modern, TINY rooms.
Pros: Great location, modern, next furnishings, smart design, great lounge, bar and 24 hour bodega (no room service).
Cons: The rooms are tiny, even for NY standards. It was a bit shocking. Might be too cramped for a couple and ideal for single travelers.
Location: Popular Thai restaurant right next door. Just 2 blocks from the Empire State Building.

Mornings are the best!
I was very tempted to just bang out a quick little __t was great_ sort of review, but I owe the hotel a little more than that. It__ a unique place from an American perspective. I__e stayed in similar tiny hotels overseas, but here, in the states, where we__e used to having so much space it immediately seems small. Think of the tiny houses you see on the facebooks. It__ like that. My room was small. An entrance hallway, a king size bed surrounded by floor to ceiling windows, and a bathroom. And it was wonderful. Leave the vinyl blinds up and let the gauzy cotton curtains in place and the morning sun diffuses through the room with a slightly blueish glow as the city slowly comes alive outside the windows. Each morning I lay silently in the clean white sheets under the soft white comforter and reveled in the silence. I was happy here.
Pros: The location was perfect for me. I used the hotel as a launch pad to explore mid town. Walked to the Empire State building, the library, St. Paul__.

Cosy Rooms and Central Location
This hotel represents the true NYC's style of living. I love how small the rooms are but they still managed to include all the aminities in organized way. The hotel is near Korea Town and The Empire State Building. Not that far from Times Square (10 blocks) and major Penn Station subway station is a walking distance. Everything about this hotel is great. One think that Is not comfy are the pillows. I think they are too fluffy to the level that it may annoy some people. Otherwise, the hotel is superb!

Brand new hotel and worth the stay
I didn't even know Arlo NoMad was less than 2 months old! It was a great place to stay. The staff was incredibly nice and helpful and the lobby music was always on point. Our room, small as expected was comfortable with the 2 of us staying in it. Had a safe, mini fridge, sweet city view and was very clean with enough space for our materials. The location is in perfect walking distance of stores like Macy's and places like Times Square. Nice place to stay during the New Years holiday. I did not care for how the bathroom is set up in the room for there's a little lack of privacy but it wasn't that big of a deal to my gf and I. I'd check in again at the NoMad in the future.

Great for a stay in Manhattan.
Very modern interior. Extremely helpful and pleasant staff. This hotel was superbly located to visit all the attractions of Manhattan with a large choice of restaurants and other eatery's nearby. The hotel restaurant is somewhat basic in terms of furniture and comfort but the food is of a very good standard and the service is excellent. The bar on the 2nd floor is small, cosy and intimate. The rooms are, as stated by many others, very compact. However, the fittings and furniture are of a very high standard and served our needs in terms of comfort and privacy. Excellent shower. Overall I would recommend this hotel but note that it is rated as 5 stars and, as such, it may fall short of the expectations of guests who frequent only the most luxurious and most expensive hotels.
Pros: Super friendly and helpful staff. Location. Modern smart decor and comfortable, if compact, rooms.
Cons: Nothing. This hotel was perfect for us. Others might prefer more space but , if so, should choose another hotel.

A great new spot to stay in NYC
This hotel is only one month in operation (as of our stay) but it was wonderful. The rooms are small - as they say - but the use of space is such that it doesn't matter. The space was clean and comfortable. What sets this apart is also the other spaces in the hotel, the terraces, and the library, as well as the two lounges. We had a lot of fun in these areas with our family. They had games, puzzles, and books available - a great use during a very rainy afternoon. The staff was quite helpful, too.

Very convenient place close to everything
If you need a touristic location hotel, this is the place. Close to pretty much everything in Manhattan, with a gorgeous view on the top floor to the Empire State. Everything is pretty much new, so also clean. And I liked the convenience of a coffee shop in the lobby. The standard rooms are not very big, yes. Maybe that¬¥s the only downside. But if you need to go around Manhattan, this is in a perfect location.
Pros: Location and top floor view
Cons: Heater in the rooms
Location: You can walk to the Empire State Building, Time Square, all the iconic places nearby, and even taking a taxi is convenient.

Perfect Stay
I had a wonderful stay at Arlo Christmas weekend. All the front desk staff were really friendly and helpful which is a very rare thing to find in a NYC hotel! The room was small but had an amazing view. There is a bodega in the lobby that's open 24/7 and has decent pizza and pastries. The location worked out perfectly for me, just a 20 min walk to Times square and I got to walk up and down 5th ave getting there. Overall I really enjoyed my stay and I hope they maintain their level of service and good rates and I will stay there every time I'm in the city!

Very nice! Would come back!
Came as friends, left as a couple. Hard to argue with that. Like it too. Only real concern is that the somewhat strange connection between the toilet and the shower, which are both separated from the rest of the room by a sliding door that doesn't close fully. We found this hilarious and just kinda rolled with it but I could see it being an awkward surprise for others who aren't fully comfortable with each other or who don't plan to preemptively take a dump elsewhere (it won't be a secret at Arlo!)

Great value hotel - conveniently located by Empire State Building and Korea-town! Clean and excellent customer service and amenities (i.e., restaurant, small bar, coffee and snack bar, lounge and study area all conveniently located in the hotel). Only downside is the room was extremely small. I frequent NYC and stay in similar boutique hotels in the area. All of them are small, but this hotel offerer even smaller rooms, particularly the bathrooms. Bathroom offers little to no privacy even for couples.

Awesome, clean, trendy hotel with great staff
Our stay was great! The front desk associates were incredibly friendly and helpful. We stayed on the 27th floor with a view of the Empire State Building. It was beautiful. The rooftop bar wasn't opened yet, which was a bummer, as we thought it would be... but could tell that when it does open, it is going to be fantastic. The views (clearly I'm obsessed with the views) are insane from the rooftop! Also, the scent of the hotel when you walk in is AMAZING! Lastly- while having a drink at the 2nd floor bar, the bartender gave us a great tip for an easy, hip, inexpensive restaurant/bar around the corner, which came in clutch after a long day of walking around and not wanting to try hard to find a place to eat/drink. DEFINITELY want to stay again for my next visit.

Tiny hotel rooms and work to do on hotel structure
The room while new, is very small. Washbasin is in room and the bed fills the rest. Would be uncomfortable for two as nowhere to sit. Has quite a good view but because the walls are glass to make rooms look bigger, it is very noisy. I was woken by sledgehammer at 7.00am. It also took 20 minutes to get down in the elevator in the morning and I missed my train as a consequence. Better deals elsewhere with more comfort.
Pros: location and it is new
Cons: Most things but the major problem of room size cannot be fixed.
Location: Mid-town Manhattan so lots to do and see - good for subway.

Great location, great bed!
We stayed at the Arlo NoMad because it was close to Penn Station--we hit a winner! The staff were congenial and helpful (pointing out we could see the Empire State Building from our room, for example) and the restaurant and bar were top-notch. Although the room was small, the bed was fabulous and, really, in NYC, all you need the room for is the bed. The location was great--it's between the Eastside and Westside, so it was easy to grab subways, and both the Village and midtown were walkable. We'd stay there again in a heartbeat.
Pros: The location, the staff, the restaurant and bar
Location: Penn Station is about 6 blocks away; midtown and the Village are within easy walking distance. The Empire State Building and jazz clubs are near.

They lost water on my last night there
The rooms are tiny, there are no amenities (no gym, no room service, etc), and the hotel staff is rather unaccommodating. On our last night there, the hotel completely lost power and I was unable to shower before going to work. Upon checkout, they promised to reimburse me one night's stay, but never fulfilled on that promise. I contacted them several times and they only bounce me around from one ""manager"" to the next.

There are 2 problems that I see them as a minor: 1. Small room about 14 sqft 2. There are only 2 elevators for 31 floors so sometimes it takes 5 minutes to go up or down You should remember that those 2 problems are the in most of all the hotels in New York

20 Blocks Away from Times Square, Rockefeller Ctr
This hotel is 15-22 blocks away from all the main locations for tourists. We walked from the hotel to Times Square several times and it was not bad. There is a subway line 3-5 blocks from the hotel to the green line. Not too far to visit the World Trade Center, Status of Liberty, China Town etc. We did not use a taxi to see places but walked and took the train everywhere. Rooms are pretty small. The room we stayed in had a sliding door for the bathroom so not very private if you are sharing with another person. There was construction going on so it was a bit inconvenient during our visit as elevator didn't work and at times extremely slow and we were on the 24th floor. Overall, good hotel. In Korea town so lots of restaurants and convenient stores around. Only a few blocks from Empire State building.
Pros: Location

A+Micro Hotel, good view of Empire State Building
I read about Arlo Hotels in a Wired Magazine article on micro Hotels. I got a great last minute deal. First impression, the hotel had a great modern lobby, with nice decor, there is a 24hr coffee/food cafe right when you walk in, and great lounge/bar areas towards the back. 2nd floor has great area for people on business trips, feels like a WeWork bullpen for the Tech crowd. Room was great, however very tiny. Think a cruise ship cabin (with no balcony) that has been very modernized, we loved the room, except for Bathroom/Show Combo. Its just a frosted door that slides, no real door for when you need alittle time and there are two people in the room! Wish there was a door and a fan to separate you from rest of the room, no fun having a piece of glass between you, your girlfriend and rest of the room, when you are trying to take care of your No. 2 business. Also the Elevator is slow and gets crowded quick, expect a 7min trip during peak hrs.

Nice but very small
The hotel is in a good location and close to a number of attractions. The staff are very attentive and professional. The look and feel of the hotel is modern and vibrant. The rooms, even by NYC standards are extremely small, barely big enough for 2 adults to comfortably move around without banging into each other. No real amenities in the room such as a coffee maker and no place to leave things out in the bathroom. Nice if you are travelling alone.

Clean and Comfortable Hotel
The room was small but had a very comfortable bed and a great shower. It was very clean and new. There were issues with the elevators not working properly which was a problem as we were on the 20th floor and it took quite a while to get up and down. This is a great hotel for a short stay when you don't have to spend a lot of time in the hotel room. The lounge and bar areas were great and the service was excellent.

Great spot right in the middle of the city. Rooms were what to be expected for a New York hotel, but I would stay there again just for the location alone. We walked everywhere because it was a perfect location.

Luxury micro hotel
Wonderful front desk service, and beautiful view from my room! Only negative was the fact that the rooftop bar was closed, and that the downstairs bar closed earlier than I'd been told. The bartender downstairs and the barista at the front were both unfriendly because they wanted to close out, and the bartender refused me service, but did so in a rude way (after ignoring me and making me stand there for minutes). Other than that, the front desk staff was kind and the cleaning staff was, as well. I still loved my stay here. It was the perfect solo getaway, and certainly stress-free.

It wasn't worth saving money versus comfort. Room incredibly small. They don't have a microwave. One elevator worked two of the three nights I was there. The hose keeping staff and night staff were excellent though. They went above to try and make me happy when things went wrong.

The hotel room was very clean and the room service did a great job maintaining the cleanliness. The hotel is newly constructed. The hotel rooms are modern, clean, and tasteful. Most importantly, the staff was very friendly, efficient, calm, and accommodating. We had an excellent experience.

Really great hotel, will stay again!
I travel a lot for work. I am in NYC almost weekly and have been searching for my go-to hotel in the NoMad area. I have finally found it! This hotel is on the smaller side, very good for people traveling alone. Its modern, quiet and clean, and it smells great (like so good- I want to know what the scent is!) There is a restaurant on the first floor that makes pizza with no crust, instead they build the edges of the pizza with Crispy Cheese. It's amazing! Highly recommend!
Cons: I found the water took a little long to heat up, once it got going the shower was awesome!

small, but very nice and well designed
Knew going in room would be small. But it was just me. One person on business. Preferred the value price vs size. Was surprised at how functional the room was though. Had a nice little desk area. Very comfortable king sized bed with plenty of plugs on the night stand. Enough room on the sink area for toiletries. Place to hang close and store the suitcase. Shower head/water volume was delicious. I never felt cramped. Hotel had a very nice little restaurant and bar area. Highly recommended for business travelers.

Small but modern, clean and cool!
I only had two nights here, but I wish I had more. From the first moment I entered the staff were welcoming and professional, yet really cool and approachable. The staff member who checked us in called us on the phone ten minutes after getting to our room to see if we were happy with everything and if there was anything she could get us. I've never had anyone do that before! I loved the different areas available to guests like the rooftop bar area and the study, its just a shame I wasn't around long enough to really utilise them. The Queen Sky room I was in was small but it was super clean, beautifully furnished and had two floor to ceiling windows which really opened the space up. They also provided a clothing steamer which is handy. If you want a massive room, this place is not for you, but if you don't mind compact the Arlo is great.
Pros: I loved that everything was new and clean. I loved the cool vibe that the hotel has, and bodega in the lobby is great for a coffee.

Cozy urban style in NYC
The receptionists were friendly, and their welcoming hospitality made our first stay in NYC pretty lovely, even though the rainy climate. Neat, simple and cozy room is presumably inspired by Scandinavian style, and fits for the room space limitation. Overall, well-designed room, other than washstand is situated just in front of the door, was so agreeable as urban style, and provides value for the rate.

Wonderful public spaces and staff , but tiny rooms
Excellent boutique hotel with good service but a caveat: The rooms are like tiny minimalist though well appointed small ship cabins perhaps or pods ; however the the lovely decor throughout the hotel and generously sized public spaces do make up for this ( i.e., lobby restaurant and cafe, lounges, bar ) . Recommended mostly for for solo business travelers ; a couple would be very cozy (to be generous) in the standard rooms. The staff is great: I was immediately moved into a new room when the auto room shades of my first assigned room did not work.The restaurant staff was equally terrific and substituted without charge when I could not eat the highly (and unusually) spiced oatmeal. I would stay here again despite the small rooms, which many other hotels have but without the nice public spaces of this one. Another small criticism: the large floor to ceiling room shades did not not fit closely enough to really block out the street lights streaming into my room. This should be fixed, it might not bother everybody l but I need very dark room to sleep .

Gets The Job Done
The hotel is brand new so it still has that clean feeling. I know it is located in midtown Manhattan, but I stayed in a 'premier' room and the room was literally a bed and a bathroom. It kind of felt like a city tree house , as the walls were all glass. The bathroom does not have a full door, it is open on top, so it almost feels as though you are sleeping right next to the toilet. The mini fridge was not stocked with anything, not even a bottle of water. I would say if you are a single person who just needs a place for the night, it is fine. However, being both my husband and myself, this room was a bit cramped (no closet, no nothing). I also go this room as an Expedia VIP and received no such VIP treatment. I would stay here again in a pinch, but would not choose it as my first choice.
Pros: The hotel is brand new so it feels clean.
Cons: The elevator area in the lobby is incredibly cramped. It also takes a long time to get the elevator. My husband got impatient and walked 15 flights

New hotel and friendly people!
Brand new hotel. Everything is spotless and pleasing. You will be greeted by friendly faces and staff that goes out of their way to make sure you are comfortable and situated. The common areas of the hotel are very inviting. Relax and have a coffee in the second floor spacious and airy sitting room. Go and have a cocktail in the hip in a good way bar area. All in all, many nice spaces. The rooms are bright and clean with modern lines. You will appreciate the good use of space as there isn't any wasted. We loved the rainfall shower and the beds are very comfortable. We were on the 24th floor and the view was nice and quiet! You can't beat floor to ceiling windows! I definitely hope I have another trip to NYC soon so I can stay at this very nice hotel. I stayed here with my teenage daughter and she loved it.
Pros: Clean, new, friendly people and great location.
Cons: I don't know about improved, everything was perfect, but don't expect lavish amenities as this is not the plaza.

OCT IN NYC
Overall a nice modern Hotel with a really great staff. The rooms are very small and are better suited to one person not two. Our room had a queen bed which was comfortable but lacked sufficient space for moving around without being smashed against the flat screen tv on the wall. There is little or no storage and two carry on bags filled the room. We had breakfast at Harold's in the Hotel and enjoyed our meal, again the staff were all very nice and the service was good.
Location: Nice SOHO location for sightseeing in the area.

Tyytyv√§inen asiakas
Hiljainen hotelli ja huippusijainti, turvallisen tuntuinen kun hissiink√§√§n ei p√§√§se ilman korttiavainta. Yst√§v√§llinen henkil√∂kunta. Kaikki sujui hyvin. Sis√§√§n- uloskirjautuminen vaivatonta. Toinen kerta oltiin ja jos tarvetta hotelliin niin se on t√§m√§ sama.

Die Zimmer (23. Stock, QueenRoom City) sind zwar etwas klein aber sehr ger√§umig und super modern gestaltet. Das gesamte Hotel mit seiner Rooftop-Bar und dem tollen Personal ist ausgezeichnet und empfehlenswert. Dazu kommt eine ausgezeichnete Lage von welcher man alles schnell zu Fu_ oder per subway erreicht. Das Publikum ist eher jung, wirkte aber immer sehr ordentlich. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck kostet (wenn man es nicht inkludiert hat) 20$/Tag extra und wird dem Anspruch des Hotels leider √ºberhaupt nicht gerecht. Grunds√§tzlich zwar ein eher europ√§isches Fr√ºhst√ºck aber mit sehr geringer Auswahl; Wurst usw. gibt es √ºberhaupt nicht. Der Orangensaft kommt aus dem Kanister. Das Obst dagegen ist lecker und frisch, ein paar Croissants usw. sind auch gut, das war es aber auch.

Ein gutes Hotel f√ºr ein paar Tage St√§dtetrip, sollte es jedoch ein l√§ngerer Urlaub werden, w√ºrde ich ein Hotel mit mehr Komfort empfehlen. Die Ausstattung und Personal sind gut, aber nicht herausragend. Es ist, wie in NY oftmals √ºblich, sehr beengt. Das Personal ist nett, wirkt aber manchmal ein bisschen √ºberheblich, besonders wenn die ganze Rezeption voller Mitarbeiter ist, man als Gast aber nicht dazwischenkommt. Das Hotel bietet ansonsten aber noch ein tolles Angebot an Events. Ob Musik, Sport oder Lesung, jeden Tag gibt es andere M√∂glichkeiten, auch die Dachterasse ist sehr sch√∂n.

the location is excellent which is just next to the main street. 2 block away from Empire state building, 1 block away from 33th street Metro station(Green line), cafe, restaurant are besides the hotel. We upgraded 2 nights of our room from CITY to SKY. Although the room is not big enough (cant open the luggage all the time, but its normal in the big city, like Tokyo) but they are tidy, clean and cosy! the staffs are helpful and kindness on everything you need.
